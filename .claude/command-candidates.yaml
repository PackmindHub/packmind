Si t# Command Candidates
# This file captures reusable task patterns that could be valuable as commands/recipes.
# AI agents silently log workflows here when they complete tasks that represent common,
# repeatable patterns that could benefit developers across projects.
#
# Each entry contains:
# - name: Kebab-case identifier (e.g., "setup-jest-testing")
# - description: 1-2 sentences explaining what the command does
# - category: Type of task (setup, testing, api, database, etc.)
# - frequency: How often it would be used (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
# - complexity: Scope and difficulty (simple, medium, complex)
# - timestamp: When it was captured (ISO 8601)
# - context: Brief note about when/why this was captured
# - applicability: How widely applicable (project-specific, cross-project, universal)
# - tags: Keywords for filtering/searching
#
# Review this file periodically to:
# - Prioritize which patterns to formalize as full commands
# - Build a library of reusable workflows
# - Identify common tasks worth automating
# - Standardize approaches across projects
