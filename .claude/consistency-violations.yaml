# AI Agent Consistency Violation Log
#
# This file captures inconsistencies discovered in the codebase by AI agents
# during exploration or coding work. It helps track places where different
# parts of the codebase handle similar concerns differently.
#
# Review this file periodically to:
# - Understand where the codebase lacks consistency
# - Prioritize which inconsistencies to address first
# - Create new standards to prevent future occurrences
# - Plan refactoring sessions
# - Make decisions about which pattern to adopt as standard
#
# File is managed by the consistency-violation-capture skill.
# Schema: See .claude/skills/consistency-violation-capture/SKILL.md
