# AI Agent Technical Decision Log
#
# This file captures implicit technical decisions made by AI agents during
# coding work. It helps track what architectural and design choices were made
# without explicit user guidance or documented standards.
#
# Review this file periodically to:
# - Understand what technical choices were made and why
# - Validate or question specific implementation decisions
# - Identify patterns that should become formal standards
# - Provide feedback for future AI agent implementations
# - Use signal-capture to formalize good patterns into standards
#
# File is managed by the decision-capture skill.
# Schema: See .claude/skills/decision-capture/SKILL.md

  context: 'Creating the decision-capture skill itself'
  category: 'architecture'
  decision: 'Structure the skill with comprehensive examples and comparison with uncertainty-capture and signal-capture skills'
  reasoning: 'Users need to understand the distinctions between these three similar skills. Comprehensive examples demonstrate when to use each skill and what kind of entries to create.'
