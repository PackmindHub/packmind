# AI Agent Implicit Decision Log
#
# This file captures implicit technical decisions and uncertainties encountered
# by AI agents during coding work. It helps track what architectural and design
# choices were made without explicit user guidance or documented standards.
#
# Review this file periodically to:
# - Understand what technical choices were made and why
# - Identify what uncertainties the AI had during implementation
# - Validate or question specific implementation decisions
# - Identify patterns that should become formal standards
# - Create explicit guidelines in CLAUDE.md
# - Add standards to Packmind
# - Use signal-capture to formalize good patterns into standards
#
# File is managed by the implicit-decision-capture skill.
# Schema: See .claude/skills/implicit-decision-capture/SKILL.md

  context: 'Creating the implicit-decision-capture skill'
  category: 'architecture'
  question: 'Should the decisions.yaml file be tracked in git or gitignored?'
  decision: 'Track in git so teams can collaborate on context improvement'
  reasoning: 'This is team-wide context that everyone should review and improve, similar to CLAUDE.md'
  alternatives:
    - 'Gitignore it and keep it local to each developer'
    - 'Make it optional via configuration'

  context: 'Creating the implicit-decision-capture skill'
  category: 'architecture'
  decision: 'Merge uncertainty-capture and decision-capture into a single skill'
  reasoning: 'Both skills captured the same concept (implicit decisions) with only minor differences. A single skill reduces cognitive overhead and eliminates the "log to both files" edge case.'
  alternatives:
    - 'Keep separate skills for questions vs decisions'
    - 'Create three-way merge with a new skill'

  context: 'Fixing pre-existing lint errors while adding SSEEventPublisher mock'
  category: 'patterns'
  question: 'How should I fix unused parameter lint errors in a stub class implementing an interface?'
  decision: 'Use underscore prefix for unused parameters (_jobsOptions, _listeners, _jobId) combined with eslint-disable comments'
  reasoning: 'The SyncJob class is a test stub that implements IQueue interface. The unused parameters are required by the interface contract but not needed for the in-memory stub implementation. Using underscore prefix signals intent while eslint-disable silences the warnings without refactoring the interface.'
  alternatives:
    - 'Refactor IQueue interface to make parameters optional'
    - 'Remove parameters from method signatures (would break interface compliance)'
    - 'Add no-op usage of parameters just to silence linter'
