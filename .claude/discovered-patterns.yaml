# AI Agent Pattern Discovery Log
#
# This file captures recurring patterns discovered in the codebase by AI agents
# during exploration. It surfaces implicit conventions that exist in practice
# but aren't formally documented.
#
# Review this file periodically to:
# - Understand implicit conventions in the codebase
# - Decide which patterns to formalize as standards
# - Identify patterns that should be enforced
# - Create documentation from observed practices
# - Build onboarding materials for new developers
#
# File is managed by the pattern-discovery-capture skill.
# Schema: See .claude/skills/pattern-discovery-capture/SKILL.md

  evidence:
    - file: .claude/skills/implicit-decision-capture/SKILL.md
      observation: 'Follows purpose → when to use → workflow → examples → integration structure'

  consistency: 'strong'
