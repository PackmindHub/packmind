# AI Agent Uncertainty Log
#
# This file captures questions, uncertainties, and decisions made by AI agents
# during coding work. It helps identify gaps in project context and guidelines.
#
# Review this file periodically to:
# - Understand what assumptions were made
# - Create explicit guidelines in CLAUDE.md
# - Add standards to Packmind
# - Improve future AI agent performance
#
# File is managed by the uncertainty-capture skill.
# Schema: See .claude/skills/uncertainty-capture/SKILL.md

  context: 'Creating the uncertainty-capture skill itself'
  category: 'architecture'
  question: 'Should the questions.yaml file be tracked in git or gitignored?'
  decision_made: 'Made it tracked by git so teams can collaborate on context improvement'
  reasoning: 'This is team-wide context that everyone should review and improve, similar to CLAUDE.md'
  alternatives:
    - 'Gitignore it and keep it local to each developer'
    - 'Make it optional via configuration'
  confidence: 'high'
