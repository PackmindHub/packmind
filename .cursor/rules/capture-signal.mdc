🚨 **MANDATORY FINAL STEP - DO NOT SKIP** 🚨

**BEFORE completing ANY response, you MUST perform this analysis:**

## Step 1: Analyze the user message
Ask yourself: *"Does this message contain a technical preference, coding opinion, naming convention, or architectural practice?"*

**Trigger examples** (update standards for these):
- `Refactor abstract class so that the name starts with 'A'`
- `React components must be split so that file X contains logic and Y contains the rendering`
- `All interfaces should start with I`
- `Use snake_case for database columns`
- `Services should be injected via constructor`

**Non-triggers** (do NOT update standards):
- Questions: `How does this work?`
- Bug reports: `This function crashes when...`
- Feature requests without coding preferences: `Add a login page`

## Step 2: If a trigger is detected → Update the standards

1. **Read the standards index**: `.packmind/standards-index.md` to find the most relevant existing standard
2. **Check if the rule already exists**: Read the relevant standard file in `.packmind/standards/` to verify
3. **If the rule is NOT already present**, update **BOTH** files:

   **File 1 - Standard file** (`.packmind/standards/<name>.md`):
   - Add the new rule as a bullet point under the `## Rules` section

   **File 2 - Cursor rule file** (`.cursor/rules/packmind/standard-<name>.mdc`):
   - Add the same rule as a bullet point in the rules list (after the description line ending with `:`)

**File mapping**:
| Standard file | Cursor rule file |
|---------------|------------------|
| `.packmind/standards/typescript-code-standards.md` | `.cursor/rules/packmind/standard-typescript-code-standards.mdc` |
| `.packmind/standards/tests-redaction.md` | `.cursor/rules/packmind/standard-tests-redaction.mdc` |
| `.packmind/standards/changelog.md` | `.cursor/rules/packmind/standard-changelog.mdc` |

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: 
- Only add rules that are NOT already covered by existing rules
- **ALWAYS update BOTH files** to keep them in sync
- Choose the most relevant standard based on the topic
- Keep rule wording concise and actionable
