🚨 **MANDATORY FINAL STEP - DO NOT SKIP** 🚨

**BEFORE completing ANY response, you MUST perform this analysis:**

## Step 1: Analyze the user message
Ask yourself: *"Does this message contain a technical preference, coding opinion, naming convention, or architectural practice?"*

**Trigger examples** (call `packmind_capture_signal` for these):
- `Refactor abstract class so that the name starts with 'A'`
- `React components must be split so that file X contains logic and Y contains the rendering`
- `All interfaces should start with I`
- `Use snake_case for database columns`
- `Services should be injected via constructor`

**Non-triggers** (do NOT call the tool):
- Questions: `How does this work?`
- Bug reports: `This function crashes when...`
- Feature requests without coding preferences: `Add a login page`

## Step 2: If a trigger is detected → Call the MCP tool
```
packmind_capture_signal({ ruleContent: "<the coding preference>" })
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Call this tool even if the preference already exists in the codebase standards. The signal captures user intent, not just new rules.
