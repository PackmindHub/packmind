## Standard: Testing good practices

Define unit test structure and naming in *.spec.ts(x) files by using verb-first assertive titles, Arrange-Act-Assert organization without comments, nested describe('when...') blocks, and one expect per test to improve readability, maintainability, and debugging clarity. :
* Follow  'Arrange, Act, Assert' pattern
* Move 'when' contextual clauses from `it()` into nested `describe('when...')` blocks
* Remove explicit 'Arrange, Act, Assert' comments from tests and structure them so the setup, execution, and verification phases are clear without redundant labels
* Use assertive, verb-first unit test names instead of starting with 'should'
* Use one expect per test case for better clarity and easier debugging; group related tests in describe blocks with shared setup in beforeEach
