Apply good practices for test redaction in **/*.spec.ts files using single expectations, assertive titles, and nested describe blocks for workflows to improve test clarity and maintainability during the development and testing of TypeScript applications. :
* Tests have a single expectation
* Tests have an assertive title and do not start with should
* Tests that show a workflow uses multiple describe to nest steps
