# Security Policy

## Our Commitment

The Packmind team takes the security of our software and infrastructure seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community in helping us maintain a secure project.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for all Packmind versions.

Security updates are applied to the `main` branch and released as soon as possible after verification.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We use GitHub's Security Advisories for receiving and managing security vulnerability reports. This ensures that sensitive information remains private until a fix is available.

### How to Report

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/security/advisories) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the advisory form with as much detail as possible

### Scope

Please report any security issues related to:

- **Codebase vulnerabilities**: Authentication bypasses, injection flaws, XSS, CSRF, insecure dependencies, etc.
- **Infrastructure and deployment issues**: Container security, configuration vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, etc.

### What to Include

To help us triage and address the issue quickly, please include:

- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed instructions to verify the issue
- **Affected components**: Which parts of the system are vulnerable
- **Suggested fix** (optional): Your recommendation for remediation
- **Proof of concept** (optional): Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 6 hours of submission
- **Initial assessment**: Within 24 hours
- **Resolution**: Within 3 days for critical issues, longer for lower severity

We will keep you informed throughout the process and credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Security Update Process

1. **Verification**: We confirm and assess the vulnerability
2. **Fix development**: We develop and test a patch
3. **Advisory publication**: We publish a GitHub Security Advisory
4. **Release**: We release the fix in a new version
5. **Notification**: We notify users through GitHub releases and advisories

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** process:

- Please give us a reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure
- We will work with you to understand the issue and develop a fix
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow this policy

## Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities in dependencies that are already publicly known
- Issues that require physical access to a user's device
- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of service attacks

## Recognition

While we do not offer a bug bounty program, we deeply appreciate the security community's contributions. Researchers who report valid security issues will be:

- Credited in the security advisory
- Acknowledged in our release notes
- Listed in our security acknowledgments (if desired)

## Questions?

If you have questions about this policy or need to discuss a security concern that doesn't fit the reporting process above, please open a discussion in the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/discussions).

Thank you for helping keep Packmind and our users safe!
