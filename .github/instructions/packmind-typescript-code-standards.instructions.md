## Standard: Typescript code standards

Adopt TypeScript code standards by prefixing interfaces with "I" and abstract classes with "Abstract" while choosing "Type" for plain objects and "Interface" for implementations to enhance clarity and maintainability when writing .ts files. :
* Prefix abstract classes with Abstract
* Prefix interfaces with I
* Use Type for plain objects, Interface when implmentation is required
