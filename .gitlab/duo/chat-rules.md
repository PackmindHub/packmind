# Packmind Standards

Before starting your work, make sure to review the coding standards relevant to your current task.

Always consult the sections that apply to the technology, framework, or type of contribution you are working on.

All rules and guidelines defined in these standards are mandatory and must be followed consistently.

Failure to follow these standards may lead to inconsistencies, errors, or rework. Treat them as the source of truth for how code should be written, structured, and maintained.

# Standard: Back-end TypeScript Clean Code Practices

Establish back-end TypeScript clean code rules in the Packmind monorepo (/packages/**/*.ts)—including PackmindLogger constructor injection, disciplined logger.info/error usage, top-of-file static imports, custom Error subclasses, and adapter-created use cases with their own loggers—to improve maintainability, debuggability, and consistent architecture across services. :
* Avoid excessive logger.debug calls in production code and limit logging to essential logger.info statements. Use logger.info for important business events, logger.error for error handling, and add logger.debug manually only when debugging specific issues.
* Inject PackmindLogger as a constructor parameter with a default value using a variable or a string representing the class name.
* Instantiate use cases in adapters without passing the adapter's logger; use cases must create their own logger for proper origin tracking.
* Keep all import statements at the top of the file before any other code. Never use dynamic imports in the middle of the code unless absolutely necessary for code splitting or lazy loading.
* Use dedicated error types instead of generic Error instances to enable precise error handling and improve code maintainability. Create custom error classes that extend Error with descriptive names and context-specific information.

# Standard: Changelog

Maintain CHANGELOG.MD using Keep a Changelog format with a top [Unreleased] section linked to HEAD, ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD), and per-release comparison links like [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/compare/release/<previous>...release/X.Y.Z to ensure accurate, consistent release documentation and version links. :
* Ensure all released versions have their corresponding comparison links defined at the bottom of the CHANGELOG.MD file in the format [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/compare/release/<previous>...release/X.Y.Z
* Format all release dates using the ISO 8601 date format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-11-21) to ensure consistent and internationally recognized date representation
* Maintain an [Unreleased] section at the top of the changelog with its corresponding link at the bottom pointing to HEAD to track ongoing changes between releases

# Standard: Testing good practices

Standardize unit test structure and naming in TypeScript/TSX test files using verb-first descriptions, Arrange-Act-Assert flow without comments, nested describe('when...') context blocks, and single-expect test cases to improve readability, maintainability, and debugging. :
* Follow  'Arrange, Act, Assert' pattern
* Move 'when' contextual clauses from `it()` into nested `describe('when...')` blocks
* Remove explicit 'Arrange, Act, Assert' comments from tests and structure them so the setup, execution, and verification phases are clear without redundant labels
* Use assertive, verb-first unit test names instead of starting with 'should'
* Use one expect per test case for better clarity and easier debugging; group related tests in describe blocks with shared setup in beforeEach

# Standard: Typescript good practices

Enforce TypeScript error and DTO conventions by prohibiting Object.setPrototypeOf in custom errors and requiring intersection types (DomainType & { extraField: T }) for presentation DTO enrichment to improve reliability and catch domain-field drift at compile time. :
* Do not use `Object.setPrototypeOf` when defining errors.
* When defining a presentation DTO that enriches a domain type, use an intersection type (`DomainType & { extraField: T }`) instead of manually re-declaring the domain type's fields, so that structural drift is caught at compile time.
