# Packmind Standards Index

This standards index contains all available coding standards that can be used by AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to find and apply proven practices in coding tasks.

## Available Standards

- [Changelog](./standards/changelog.md) : Maintain CHANGELOG.MD using Keep a Changelog format with a top [Unreleased] section linked to HEAD, ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD), and per-release comparison links like [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/compare/release/<previous>...release/X.Y.Z to ensure accurate, consistent release documentation and version links.
- [Tests redaction](./standards/tests-redaction.md) : Apply good practices for test redaction in **/*.spec.ts files using single expectations, assertive titles, and nested describe blocks for workflows to improve test clarity and maintainability during the development and testing of TypeScript applications.
- [Typescript code standards](./standards/typescript-code-standards.md) : Adopt TypeScript code standards by prefixing interfaces with "I" and abstract classes with "Abstract" while choosing "Type" for plain objects and "Interface" for implementations to enhance clarity and maintainability when writing .ts files.
