# Packmind Standards Index

This standards index contains all available coding standards that can be used by AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to find and apply proven practices in coding tasks.

## Available Standards

- [Changelog](./standards/changelog.md) : Maintain CHANGELOG.MD using Keep a Changelog format with a top [Unreleased] section linked to HEAD, ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD), and per-release comparison links like [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/compare/release/<previous>...release/X.Y.Z to ensure accurate, consistent release documentation and version links.
- [Testing good practices](./standards/testing-good-practices.md) : Define unit test structure and naming in *.spec.ts(x) files by using verb-first assertive titles, Arrange-Act-Assert organization without comments, nested describe('when...') blocks, and one expect per test to improve readability, maintainability, and debugging clarity.
