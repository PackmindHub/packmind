# Typescript code standards

Basic good practices when writing Typescript

## Rules

* Prefix abstract classes with Abstract
* Prefix interfaces with I
* Use Type for plain objects, Interface when implmentation is required
* Use arrow functions instead of traditional functions when the function does not use the keyword "this"
