- When running commands, ensure you use the correct Node version (see .nvmrc at the project's root level)
- When renaming or moving a file that is commited to git, use `git mv` instead of `mv`

# Issues Management

- Issues are defined and tracked in the **Packmind MonoRepo GitHub Project** (Project #2)
- All development work should reference the appropriate GitHub issue number when applicable
- Issues follow a structured workflow: Backlog → Todo → In Progress → To review → Done

## GitHub MCP Issue Operations

The GitHub MCP provides tools to interact with issues programmatically:

### List Issues
```typescript
mcp_github_list_issues({
  owner: "PackmindHub",
  repo: "packmind-monorepo",
  state: "OPEN",        // "OPEN", "CLOSED", or omit for all
  perPage: 50           // Number of results per page
})
```

### Get Specific Issue
```typescript
mcp_github_get_issue({
  owner: "PackmindHub",
  repo: "packmind-monorepo", 
  issue_number: 197     // The issue number (not ID)
})
```

### Add Comment to Issue
```typescript
mcp_github_add_issue_comment({
  owner: "PackmindHub",
  repo: "packmind-monorepo",
  issue_number: 197,
  body: "## Your comment content\n\nMarkdown is supported for formatting."
})
```

**Note**: Use these tools to track progress, document decisions, and communicate with the team directly through GitHub issues.

# Task splitting

- For any task you perform, you MUST split it into multiple into sub-tasks which have a logical increment (eg: new endpoint, new component, new use case etc). When a task is done, run all the validation steps (lint, test, packmind etc) and ask me for validation of the work you did.
- Each sub task MUST have its own commit.
- Before commiting anything, you must ensure that `npm run quality-gate` does not raise any issue.

# Commiting

- When referencing an issue (example #123), DO NOT write "Close" or "Fix", as this closes the issue which has not been validated by other developers.
- Before proposing to commit, ALWAYS run `npm run quality-gate` and fix the issues found
- NEVER use the `--no-verify` argument when commiting
- After commiting, ALWAYS ensure that the commit was successful.

<!-- start: Packmind standards -->
# Packmind Standards

Before starting your work, make sure to review the coding standards relevant to your current task.

Always consult the sections that apply to the technology, framework, or type of contribution you are working on.

All rules and guidelines defined in these standards are mandatory and must be followed consistently.

Failure to follow these standards may lead to inconsistencies, errors, or rework. Treat them as the source of truth for how code should be written, structured, and maintained.

## Standard: Back-end repositories SQL queries using TypeORM

Utilize TypeORM's Repository or QueryBuilder methods for writing SQL queries in back-end repositories located in /infra/repositories/*Repository.ts to enhance type safety, ensure automatic parameterization, and improve maintainability of the codebase. :
* Use TypeORM’s Repository or QueryBuilder methods (e.g., repository.findOne({ where: { id } })) instead of raw SQL strings to gain type safety, automatic parameterization, and maintainability.

Full standard is available here for further request: [Back-end repositories SQL queries using TypeORM](.packmind/standards/back-end-repositories-sql-queries-using-typeorm.md)

## Standard: Back-end Typescript

Establish clean code practices in TypeScript for back-end development by limiting logger.debug calls in production, organizing import statements, using dedicated error types, and injecting PackmindLogger to enhance maintainability and ensure consistent logging across services. :
* Avoid excessive logger.debug calls in production code and limit logging to essential logger.info statements
* Inject PackmindLogger as constructor parameter with origin constant for consistent logging across services
* Keep all import statements at the top of the file before any other code
* Use dedicated error types instead of generic Error instances to enable precise error handling and improve code maintainability

Full standard is available here for further request: [Back-end Typescript](.packmind/standards/back-end-typescript.md)

## Standard: Compliance

Mask personal information in application logs across all environments using the standard format of the first 6 characters followed by "*" when logging user emails to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and safeguard user privacy. :
* Never log personal information in clear text across all log levels
* Use the standard masking format of first 6 characters followed by "*" for logging users email

Full standard is available here for further request: [Compliance](.packmind/standards/compliance.md)

## Standard: DDD monorepo architecture

Establish DDD monorepo architecture by implementing domain adapters through shared/types and managing dependencies lazily with dependency injection to prevent circular dependencies and maintain clean separation of concerns across TypeScript projects. :
* A domain package uses external domains through an adapter which implements a port defined in shared/types.
* A package expose adapters through a getter in the domain Hexa class.
* An adapter is implemented in its own domain as the root UseCases class.
* At runtime a consumer's adapter reference must be null checked where it is used. (in the usecase)
* Commands and Responses which define contracts must be defined in shared/types
* Consumers hexa should only import the 'port' interface. Consumers cannot be dependent on an adapter.
* Dependency between Hexas are handled lazily through dependency injection.

Full standard is available here for further request: [DDD monorepo architecture](.packmind/standards/ddd-monorepo-architecture.md)

## Standard: Front-end UI and Design Systems

Adopt consistent UI component usage by importing from '@packmind/ui' instead of '@chakra-ui' in React applications to ensure uniformity in design and maintainability across the front-end codebase. :
* Never use vanilla HTML tags in frontend code, only @packmind/ui components
* Prefer using the design token 'full' instead of the literal value '100%' for width or height in UI components.
* Use components imported from '@packmind/ui' instead of '@chakra-ui' packages to keep a consistent UI abstraction, e.g.  `import { PMButton } from '@packmind/ui';
* Use only semantic tokens to customize @packmind/ui components.

Full standard is available here for further request: [Front-end UI and Design Systems](.packmind/standards/front-end-ui-and-design-systems.md)

## Standard: Frontend data flow

Establish a structured frontend data flow pattern using React Router v7, @react-router/fs-routes, and TanStack Query in the Packmind codebase to centralize data fetching logic and ensure data availability before rendering, enhancing maintainability and user experience across applications. :
* Define "crumb" property in "handle" hook of RouteModule to define link for navigation breadcrumb
* Don't use gateways directly in frontend route modules. Always access data via query or mutation hooks in these modules.
* Queries options should be exported as well as hooks that use them
* Resource associated to a route should be loaded by its RouteModule in clientLoader
* Route module component name must end by "RouteModule"

Full standard is available here for further request: [Frontend data flow](.packmind/standards/frontend-data-flow.md)

## Standard: Frontend Error Management

Define explicit error boundary usage in React applications with TypeScript by implementing page-level and component-level error boundaries only when necessary, while ensuring proper error handling for async operations and event handlers, to enhance user experience and maintain clear error flows. :
* Avoid overusing error boundaries as they increase code complexity and make error flows harder to trace
* Display validation errors inline near the relevant form fields for better user experience
* Do NOT use error boundaries for errors that should be handled explicitly (form validation, expected API errors, user input errors)
* Handle TanStack Query mutation errors using onError callbacks to display contextual error messages
* Only add a page-level error boundary when you need custom error UI for a specific route (different from the default error page)
* Only add component-level error boundaries for isolated critical features where partial failure is acceptable (e.g., independent dashboard widgets that can fail without affecting the rest of the page)
* Prevent double submissions by checking mutation pending state before triggering operations
* Use the key prop to reset error boundaries by forcing React to remount the component with fresh state
* Use typed error guards (e.g., isPackmindError) to safely extract error details from API responses before displaying to users
* Wrap async operations in try-catch blocks since error boundaries do NOT catch errors in event handlers or async code

Full standard is available here for further request: [Frontend Error Management](.packmind/standards/frontend-error-management.md)

## Standard: TanStack Query Key Management

Structure TanStack Query keys hierarchically with domain-scoped constants and enums to enable predictable cache invalidation and prevent cross-domain dependencies in React applications. :
* Cross-domain imports must only include query key constants and enums
* Define base query key arrays as const to enable precise invalidation patterns
* Domain query scope must be defined as separate const outside enum
* Query invalidation must use prefix matching from key start in order
* Query keys must be defined in queryKeys.ts file in domain's api folder
* Query keys must follow hierarchical structure: organization scope, domain scope, operation, identifiers

Full standard is available here for further request: [TanStack Query Key Management](.packmind/standards/tanstack-query-key-management.md)

## Standard: Tests redaction

Redefine testing practices for both back-end and front-end applications using Jest by removing redundant comments, structuring tests for clarity, and employing assertive naming conventions to enhance test readability and reliability in TypeScript projects. :
* * Avoid testing that a method is a function; instead invoke the method and assert its observable behavior, e.g.  
  const result = myService.greet('Alice');  
  expect(result).toBe('Hello, Alice');
* Avoid asserting on stubbed logger output like specific messages or call counts; instead verify observable behavior or return values.
* Avoid testing that registry components are defined; instead test the actual behavior and functionality of the registry methods like registration, retrieval, and error handling.
* Avoid using "when" in it() test descriptions; move contextual clauses into describe('when…') blocks and keep it() descriptions focused on expected behavior.
* Remove explicit 'Arrange, Act, Assert' comments from tests and structure them so the setup, execution, and verification phases are clear without redundant labels.
* Use afterEach to call datasource.destroy() to clean up the test database whenever you initialize it in beforeEach.
* Use afterEach(() => jest.clearAllMocks()) instead of beforeEach(() => jest.clearAllMocks()) to clear mocks after each test and prevent inter-test pollution.
* Use assertive, verb-first unit test names instead of starting with 'should', e.g. it('returns null when input is empty', ...).
* Use expect(actualArray).toEqual(expectedArray) for deep array equality in Jest tests instead of manual length and index checks, e.g., expect(result).toEqual([1,2,3]);
* Use one expect per test case for better clarity and easier debugging; group related tests in describe blocks with shared setup in beforeEach
* Use stubLogger() in your Jest tests to get a fully typed PackmindLogger stub instead of manually creating a jest.Mocked<PackmindLogger> object with jest.fn() methods.
* Use the factory functions from @packmind/shared (e.g., createGitRepoId, createStandardId, createRecipeId) instead of creating custom test helper functions for type casting.

Full standard is available here for further request: [Tests redaction](.packmind/standards/tests-redaction.md)

## Standard: Use cases

Define use cases for each public method in a hexagonal architecture using TypeScript, ensuring they are stored in `types/<domain>/contracts/` and properly typed with commands and responses to enhance code organization and maintainability across shared packages. :
* Admin use cases must extend `AbstractAdminUseCase` and implement `executeForAdmins`
* Gateway interfaces should only be defined as an object of `Gateway<...>` (or `PublicGateway<...>` for public endpoints)
* Member use cases must extend `AbstractMemberUseCase` and implement `executeForMembers`
* Public use cases must implement `IPublicUseCase` directly
* The only allowed public method for a use case is `execute` (or `executeForMembers` and `executeForAdmins` for the ones extending the abstract use cases)
