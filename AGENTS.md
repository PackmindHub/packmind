# Packmind Recipes

ðŸš¨ **MANDATORY STEP** ðŸš¨

Before writing, editing, or generating ANY code:

**ALWAYS READ**: @.packmind/recipes-index.md to see what recipes are available

## Recipe Usage Rules:

- **MANDATORY**: Always check the recipes index first
- **CONDITIONAL**: Only read/use individual recipes if they are relevant to your task
- **OPTIONAL**: If no recipes are relevant, proceed without using any

## Recipe Usage Tracking:

When you DO use or apply a relevant Packmind recipe from .packmind/recipes/, you MUST call the 'packmind_notify_recipe_usage' MCP tool with:

- Recipe slugs array (e.g., ["recipe-name"] from "recipe-name.md")
- aiAgent: "AGENTS.md"
- gitRepo: "PackmindHub/packmind-monorepo"

**Remember: Always check the recipes index first, but only use recipes that actually apply to your specific task.**

## Packmind Standards

Follow the coding standards defined in @.packmind/standards-index.md
