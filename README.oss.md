# Packmind - Community edition

## What's Packmind

Packmind helps engineering teams safely scale AI coding by syncing organizational decisions into GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor and other assistants, enforcing them via code checks and rewrites, and providing governance with a full ledger of what standards and recipes were applied where. Teams ship faster, with zero rework and full trust.

1. **Capture & normalize engineering playbook** - Turn scattered rules from docs and code reviews into structured, versioned standards, recipes, and workflows â€” keeping knowledge consistent and out of experts' heads.
2. **Align AI and enforce engineering playbook** - Keep per-repo instruction files always up to date so AI assistants follow organizational rules. Detect and rewrite violations before merge, eliminating costly rework. 3
3. **Govern & Scale safely** - Gradually roll out standards and recipes with scopes and drift repair to prevent architectural drift. Track what's applied where to build trust and safely scale agentic AI.
