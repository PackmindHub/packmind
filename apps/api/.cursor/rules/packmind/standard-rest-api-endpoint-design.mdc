## Standard: REST API Endpoint Design

Define REST API route and controller endpoint conventions using dedicated POST action endpoints and ownership-chain IDs with one endpoint per business action to keep endpoints predictable, self-documenting, and aligned with business intent. :
* Create one endpoint per business action rather than a single endpoint handling multiple actions via request body
* Only include resource IDs from the ownership chain in the route — omit IDs of related but non-parent resources
* Use dedicated POST action endpoints (e.g., `/reject`, `/accept`) instead of a generic PATCH with a status field in the body
