# Packmind Standards Index

This standards index contains all available coding standards that can be used by AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to find and apply proven practices in coding tasks.

## Available Standards

- [NestJS Module Hierarchy](./standards/nestjs-module-hierarchy.md) : Establish a consistent NestJS module hierarchy using RouterModule.register() for routing and dedicated modules for each resource in the apps/api/src/app/ directory to enhance maintainability and scalability by mirroring the URL hierarchy and ensuring clear separation of concerns across the codebase, applicable to all modules including controllers, services, and modules.
