# Packmind Standards

Before starting your work, make sure to review the coding standards relevant to your current task.

Always consult the sections that apply to the technology, framework, or type of contribution you are working on.

All rules and guidelines defined in these standards are mandatory and must be followed consistently.

Failure to follow these standards may lead to inconsistencies, errors, or rework. Treat them as the source of truth for how code should be written, structured, and maintained.

## Standard: [cli]

Use shared consoleLogger utilities instead of direct console.log/warn methods to standardize output formatting and enable centralized logging control. :
* Use `consoleLogger` utilities instead of console.(log/warn/...)

Full standard is available here for further request: [[cli]](.packmind/standards/cli.md)
