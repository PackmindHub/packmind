## Overview

Organizations in Packmind help you group your standards, commands, skills, and packages by team or project. Each user can belong to multiple organizations and switch between them as needed.

When you first sign up for Packmind, you'll create your first organization. You can create additional organizations at any time.

## Creating a New Organization

You can create a new organization at any point while using Packmind:

1. Click on the **organization name** in the top-left corner of the screen
2. Select **New organization** from the dropdown menu
3. Enter a name for your organization
4. Click **Create** to confirm

Your new organization will be created and automatically selected as your active organization.

## Switching Between Organizations

To switch to a different organization:

1. Click on the **organization name** in the top-left corner of the screen
2. Select the organization you want to switch to from the dropdown menu

The application will immediately switch to the selected organization, and you'll see that organization's standards, commands, packages, and settings.

<Info>
  All your work (standards, commands, skills, and packages) is
  organization-specific. When you switch organizations, you'll see different
  content and settings.
