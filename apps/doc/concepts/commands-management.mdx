## What are Commands?

Commands are one of three artifact types in Packmind, alongside [standards](/concepts/standards-management) and [skills](/concepts/skills-management).

In teams using AI coding assistants, sharing and reusing prompts that work is often tedious. A Packmind **Command** is an executable, step-by-step guide that tells the AI assistant exactly how to perform a development task so your team's practices are applied consistently and reproducibly.

Commands are repeatable and predictable instruction patterns that can be applied to achieve a specific outcome.

Examples of commands can be:

- Create or update domain model and the SQL schema, including database migrations
- Add a new use case in a business domain

## Creating Commands

Commands can be created in two ways:

1. **Through the web app** — Create commands directly in the Packmind interface
2. **Through AI assistants** — Use the `/packmind-create-command` skill for AI-guided command creation

### Creating Commands in the Web App

To create a command directly in the Packmind web app:

1. Navigate to **Commands** in the main menu
2. Click **Create**
3. Fill in the command details:
   - **Name**: A descriptive name for the command
   - **Content**: The instructions in Markdown format
4. Click **Save** to create the command

<Tip>
  Use the web app when you want to quickly create or edit commands manually. Use
  the `/packmind-create-command` skill when you want AI assistance in
  structuring commands from your development history.
</Tip>

### Creating Commands with AI Assistants

You can create commands using the `/packmind-create-command` command in your AI coding assistant.

Simply type:

```
/packmind-create-command
```

The AI agent will automatically follow the **command creation workflow**:

1. Identifies the development process you want to capture
2. Structures it into clear, actionable steps with context validation checkpoints
3. Defines specific "when to use" scenarios
4. Adds optional code examples to demonstrate each step

This command is automatically available when you run `packmind-cli skills init` or distribute packages to your repository.

### Best Practices for Command Creation

To get the best results, provide rich context to your AI agent:

- **After completing a task**: When you've accomplished a series of tasks in a session with your AI Agent, ask it to create a command based on what you've done

  ```
  Synthesize the steps we followed to create a new use case and create a Packmind command based on this
  ```

- **From Git history**: A commit or pull request can reflect a command. Ask your agent to analyze commits or a Pull Request URL

  ```
  Create a command by analyzing the changes in pull request #123
  ```

- **From existing code**: Provide files as context to extract patterns

  ```
  Create a command for adding a new API endpoint based on @routes/users.ts and @controllers/UserController.ts
  ```

The workflow ensures your command includes:

- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Context validation checkpoints (questions to ask before starting)
- Usage scenarios (when this command applies)
- Optional code snippets for each step

## Updating Commands

**Updating commands** is possible from the web app, on the dedicated section of the commands.

<Info>
  **CLI update support** — The CLI currently allows creating commands but not
  yet updating them. You can update commands through the web app. CLI support
  for updating commands is coming in Q1 2026.

## Commands Versions

Every time you update a command, this creates a new version.
This keeps track of the history of your changes, and it's useful to keep track of which versions are currently distributed to Git repositories.

## Command Identification

Each command has three identifiers:

| Identifier | Example                                | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**   | `"Add a New REST Endpoint"`            | User-facing display name in the web app                 |
| **Slug**   | `"add-a-new-rest-endpoint"`            | URL-safe identifier used for invocation and file naming |
| **ID**     | `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000` | Internal database identifier                            |

The **slug** is automatically generated from the name and used throughout the system. If you create multiple commands with similar names in the same space, Packmind appends numbers to keep slugs unique (e.g., `"add-api-endpoint"`, `"add-api-endpoint-1"`).

## How to Use Commands After Distribution

Unlike standards (which are applied automatically), commands are **user-invoked**—you run them when you need them.

Commands are identified and invoked using their **slug** (the auto-generated URL-safe name).

### Using Slash Commands (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot)

For AI assistants with native slash command support, type `/` followed by the command slug:

```
/add-a-new-rest-endpoint
```

The AI assistant will recognize the command by its slug and execute its instructions.

### Manual Invocation (Continue, GitLab Duo, Junie, AGENTS.md)

For AI assistants without native slash command support, reference the command file by its slug:

```
Execute @.packmind/commands/add-a-new-rest-endpoint.md
```

The AI assistant will read the command file and follow its instructions.

For detailed information about where commands appear for each AI assistant and all invocation methods, see [Understanding Where Your Artifacts Appear](/concepts/artifact-rendering).
