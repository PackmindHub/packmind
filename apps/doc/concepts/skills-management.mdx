## What are Skills?

Skills are reusable knowledge packages that AI coding agents can discover and use to perform tasks more accurately. Based on Claude Code skills and Agents skills specifications, they provide specialized capabilities that agents can trigger based on the task at hand.

Unlike standards (which apply automatically) and commands (which require explicit invocation), skills are **agent-discovered**—the AI automatically loads relevant skills based on context and triggers defined in the skill.

## Skill Structure

A skill is a folder containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file, plus optional supporting files.

### Required: SKILL.md

The `SKILL.md` file contains YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown instructions:

```markdown
---
name: 'skill-name'
description: 'Brief description of what this skill does'
---

# Skill Name

Instructions for when and how AI agents should use this skill.
```

**Frontmatter fields:**

| Field           | Required | Description                              |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `name`          | Yes      | Unique identifier for the skill          |
| `description`   | Yes      | Brief explanation of what the skill does |
| `license`       | No       | License type (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0)     |
| `compatibility` | No       | Which AI agents support this skill       |
| `allowed-tools` | No       | List of tools the skill may use          |
| `metadata`      | No       | Additional custom metadata               |

### Optional Supporting Files

Skills can include additional files alongside `SKILL.md`:

- **Templates** — Boilerplate code, configuration files, or scaffolding
- **Scripts** — Automation scripts the skill may reference or execute
- **Resources** — Documentation, examples, or reference materials
- **Subdirectories** — Organize complex skills with multiple related files

All files in the skill directory are packaged together when you upload the skill.

## Creating Skills

Skills are created through the CLI by uploading a skill directory:

```bash
# Create your skill directory with SKILL.md
mkdir my-skill
# Add your SKILL.md and any supporting files
# ...

# Upload to Packmind
packmind-cli skills add ./my-skill
```

For a complete walkthrough, see [Create Your First Skill](/getting-started/gs-create-skill).

## Updating Skills

When you upload a skill that already exists in your organization, Packmind automatically handles versioning:

1. **Content comparison** — The CLI compares the uploaded content against the latest version
2. **New version created** — If any content differs (changes to `SKILL.md`, new files, modified scripts, or updated assets), a new version is created
3. **No duplicate versions** — If the content is identical to the current version, no new version is created

To update an existing skill, simply upload it again:

```bash
packmind-cli skills add ./my-skill
```

The CLI will report:

- **New skill created** — If this is a new skill
- **New version created** — If changes were detected
- **Skill already up to date** — If no changes were detected

### Viewing Version History

You can view all versions of a skill in the Packmind web app:

1. Navigate to **Skills** in the main menu
2. Click on the skill you want to inspect
3. View the **Version history** section to see all versions

Each version includes a timestamp, allowing you to track when changes were made.

## Deleting Skills

You can delete skills that are no longer needed through the Packmind web app.

### Delete a Single Skill

1. Navigate to **Skills** in the main menu
2. Click on the skill you want to delete
3. Click the **Delete** button
4. Confirm the deletion in the dialog

### Delete Multiple Skills

To delete multiple skills at once:

1. Navigate to **Skills** in the main menu
2. Select the skills you want to delete using the checkboxes
3. Click **Delete selected**
4. Confirm the batch deletion in the dialog

<Warning>
  **Impact on packages** — When you delete a skill that's included in one or
  more packages, those packages will be updated. You'll need to redistribute the
  affected packages to remove the skill from your repositories.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Skill deletion is only available through the web interface. There is currently
  no CLI command for deleting skills.
</Note>

## Viewing Skills

Access your skills through the Packmind web app:

1. Navigate to **Skills** in the main menu
2. Browse the list of available skills
3. Click a skill to view its details

The skill details view shows:

- **Description** — What the skill does
- **Files** — All files included in the skill
- **Version history** — Track changes over time
- **Packages** — Which packages include this skill

## Skills in Packages

Skills can be added to packages alongside commands and standards. To add a skill to a package:

1. Go to **Packages** in the web app
2. Edit an existing package or create a new one
3. Select skills to include
4. Save the package

When you distribute a package, all included skills are deployed together with your other artifacts.

<Tip>
  **Default skills included** — When packages are distributed (via the web app
  push strategy or CLI install), Packmind's default skills are automatically
  included. This ensures the `packmind-create-skill` skill is always available
  for creating new skills with AI assistance.
</Tip>

## Where Skills Appear After Distribution

After distributing a package containing skills, they appear in specific locations based on the AI assistant:

| AI Assistant   | Where Skills Appear                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code    | `.claude/skills/{skill-slug}/SKILL.md` |
| Cursor         | `.cursor/skills/{skill-slug}/SKILL.md` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/skills/{skill-slug}/SKILL.md` |

The source files are always stored in `.packmind/skills/` regardless of which AI assistants are enabled.

<Note>
  Skills are currently available for Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.
  Other AI assistants do not support skill rendering.
</Note>

For complete details on where artifacts appear, see [Understanding Where Your Artifacts Appear](/concepts/artifact-rendering).

## How Skills Differ from Commands and Standards

| Aspect         | Standards           | Commands                  | Skills               |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Activation** | Automatic           | User-invoked              | Agent-discovered     |
| **Purpose**    | Enforce guidelines  | Execute tasks             | Provide capabilities |
| **Creation**   | MCP or Web UI       | MCP                       | CLI only             |
| **Format**     | Rules with examples | Step-by-step instructions | SKILL.md + resources |

- **Standards** are coding guidelines that AI assistants follow automatically
- **Commands** are tasks you invoke explicitly with slash commands
- **Skills** are knowledge packages that AI agents discover and use as needed
