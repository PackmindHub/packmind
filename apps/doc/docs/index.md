# Introduction

## What's Packmind

Packmind is a developer tool that fixes two big problems every AI-native engineer runs into:

### **1️⃣ “What do I even put in these AI instructions?”**

Every tool expects its own inputs:

- **Copilot** → `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, chat modes, reusable prompts
- **Claude** → `CLAUDE.md`, commands, skills
- **Cursor** → `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
- **Kiro** → `.kiro/steering/*.md`
- _(with more formats appearing every month…)_

But your team’s **actual standards aren’t stored anywhere**:

- architecture rules → buried in Slack or Notion
- naming conventions → stuck in your head
- patterns → hiding in PR comments
- best practices → scattered across repos

👉 **Packmind helps you turn all of this into a real engineering playbook**  
(standards, commands, skills) so **AI agents finally code _your way_.**

---

### **2️⃣ “Why am I copy-pasting this across every repo and every agent?”**

Every repo.  
Every assistant.  
Different files, different folders, different formats.

Keeping everything in sync is impossible.

👉 **Packmind centralizes your playbook once — and distributes it everywhere**,  
generating the exact instruction files each AI tool needs, optimized for context.
