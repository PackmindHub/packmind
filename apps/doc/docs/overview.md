# Distribution Overview

The Distribution Overview provides a centralized view of where your commands and standards are distributed across your organization's Git repositories and targets.

## What You Can Do

### View Distributions from Multiple Perspectives

Switch between three views to analyze your distributions:

- **Repository View** - See all commands and standards distributed to each Git repository and target
- **Command View** - See where each command is distributed and track version status
- **Standard View** - See where each standard is distributed and track version status

### Track Version Status

Quickly identify outdated distributions:

- **Up-to-date** - Distributed version matches the latest version
- **Outdated** - Distributed version is older than the latest version
- **Undistributed** - Command or standard hasn't been distributed anywhere yet

### Filter Your View

Use filters to focus on what matters:

- Search by repository name, command name, or standard name
- Show only outdated distributions
- Show only undistributed items
- Filter by specific targets

Targets represent specific paths within repositories where commands and standards are distributed (e.g., `/`, `/src/frontend/`, `/src/backend/`). Each target can have different versions of commands and standards distributed.
