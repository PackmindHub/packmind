# Deployment Overview

The Deployment Overview provides a centralized view of where your recipes and standards are deployed across your organization's Git repositories and targets.

## What You Can Do

### View Deployments from Multiple Perspectives

Switch between three views to analyze your deployments:

- **Repository View** - See all recipes and standards deployed to each Git repository and target
- **Recipe View** - See where each recipe is deployed and track version status
- **Standard View** - See where each standard is deployed and track version status

### Track Version Status

Quickly identify outdated deployments:

- **Up-to-date** - Deployed version matches the latest version
- **Outdated** - Deployed version is older than the latest version
- **Undeployed** - Recipe or standard hasn't been deployed anywhere yet

### Filter Your View

Use filters to focus on what matters:

- Search by repository name, recipe name, or standard name
- Show only outdated deployments
- Show only undeployed items
- Filter by specific targets

Targets represent specific paths within repositories where recipes and standards are deployed (e.g., `/`, `/src/frontend/`, `/src/backend/`). Each target can have different versions of recipes and standards deployed.
