title: 'CLI Installation & Setup'

## Overview

The Packmind CLI is your primary tool for managing standards, commands, and skills. This guide will help you install and authenticate the CLI.

## Installation

### One-click install (Recommended)

The easiest way to install and configure the Packmind CLI is using the one-click install available in the Packmind web interface.

**Where to find it:**

- During your first onboarding after creating an account
- Anytime in your **Account Settings** page

**What it does:**

1. Downloads and installs the Packmind CLI binary for your platform
2. Authenticates you automatically with your Packmind account
3. Sets up your PATH environment variable

Simply copy the provided command and paste it into your terminal. The script handles everything automatically.

<Tip>
  **Why this is recommended** — The one-click install eliminates manual steps by
  combining installation and authentication in a single command.
</Tip>

### Alternative: npm Package

<Note>**Node.js 22 or higher required**.</Note>

**Global Installation**:

```bash
npm install -g @packmind/cli
```

After installation, the `packmind-cli` command will be available globally.

**npx** (no installation required):

```bash
npx @packmind/cli install --list
```

This runs the CLI directly without installing it, always using the latest version.

### Alternative: Standalone Executables

Download the appropriate pre-built executable for your platform from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/releases?q=CLI&expanded=true).

**Available platforms:**

- **Linux x64**: `packmind-cli-linux-x64-{version}`
- **Linux arm64**: `packmind-cli-linux-arm64-{version}`
- **macOS arm64**: `packmind-cli-macos-arm64-{version}` (signed and notarized)
- **Windows x64**: `packmind-cli-windows-x64-{version}.exe`

**For Linux/macOS**, make the executable runnable:

```bash
chmod +x packmind-cli-*-{version}
```

**Optional**: Move to a directory in your PATH for easy access:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
sudo mv packmind-cli-*-{version} /usr/local/bin/packmind-cli

# Windows: Move to a directory in your PATH or run directly
```

<Tip>
  **Choosing an Installation Method** — Use **one-click install** for the
  simplest experience with automatic authentication. Use **npm global** if you
  want `packmind-cli` always available system-wide. Use **npx** for
  project-specific usage or testing without installation. Use **standalone
  executables** if you don't have Node.js installed or need a specific binary
  for your environment.
</Tip>

## Authentication

The CLI requires authentication to communicate with your Packmind instance.

### Login Command (Recommended)

The easiest way to authenticate is using the `login` command:

```bash
packmind-cli login
```

This will:

1. Open your browser to the Packmind login page
2. After you authenticate, automatically receive credentials
3. Store credentials securely in `~/.packmind/credentials.json`

**For self-hosted instances**, specify your host:

```bash
packmind-cli login --host https://your-packmind-instance.com
```

**Manual code entry** (if browser flow doesn't work):

You can also enter a login code manually from the web interface:

```bash
packmind-cli login --code YOUR_CODE_HERE
```

### Verify Authentication

Check your current authentication status:

```bash
packmind-cli whoami
```

This displays:

- Your API key (masked)
- Connected host
- Organization name
- User name
- Credential expiration status

### API Key Authentication (Alternative)

You can authenticate using the `PACKMIND_API_KEY_V3` environment variable instead of the interactive login flow. This is the recommended approach for:

- **CI/CD pipelines** — Automated environments where interactive login isn't possible
- **Docker containers** — Pass the API key as an environment variable
- **Scripted workflows** — When you need non-interactive authentication

#### Getting Your API Key

1. Log in to your Packmind instance (Cloud or self-hosted)
2. Navigate to **Settings** (click your profile icon in the top right)
3. Scroll to the **CLI Authentication** section
4. Go to the **Environment Variable** tab
5. Click **Generate New Key** to create an API key (valid for 90 days)
6. Copy the generated key

#### Setting the Environment Variable

Set the `PACKMIND_API_KEY_V3` environment variable with your API key:

```bash
export PACKMIND_API_KEY_V3="your-api-key-here"
```

To make this permanent, add it to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.).

## Next Steps

Now that you have the CLI installed and authenticated, you can create your first standards and commands:

### Quick Start: Run `/packmind-onboard`

The fastest way to get started is to use the `/packmind-onboard` command in your AI coding assistant. This will guide your AI agent to:

1. Analyze your codebase automatically
2. Identify coding patterns and conventions
3. Generate standards and commands based on what it finds
4. Create or select a package to organize them

Simply type in your AI assistant:

```
/packmind-onboard
```

The AI agent will walk you through the entire process interactively.

### Create Individual Artifacts

You can also create standards, commands, and skills individually using these commands in your AI agent:

- **`/packmind-create-standard`** — Create a coding standard with AI guidance
- **`/packmind-create-command`** — Create a reusable command workflow
- **`/packmind-create-skill`** — Create a custom skill for your AI agents

Each command provides step-by-step guidance to ensure high-quality artifacts.
