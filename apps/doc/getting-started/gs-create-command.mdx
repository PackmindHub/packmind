title: 'Create your first command'
---

In teams using coding assistants, sharing and reusing _prompts that work_ is often tedious.

A Packmind **Command** is an executable, step-by-step guide that tells the AI assistant exactly how to perform a development task so your team's practices are applied consistently and reproducibly.

**Examples**

- “Add a new REST endpoint” — steps to define the route, implement the handler, add input validation, write tests, and update API docs.
- “Set up a CI pipeline for a project” — steps to configure the workflow, run lint/tests/build on each push/PR, and report status checks.

<Warning>
  The MCP server **must** be configured to create Commands. See the setup guide:
  [Get started with the MCP server](/getting-started/gs-mcp-server-setup).
</Warning>

## How to

1. Open your IDE and your coding assistant in **agentic mode**.
2. For this demo, we will create a **language-agnostic command**. (You can also target a specific language or framework.)
3. Type this prompt:

```text
Analyze our codebase and create a Packmind command to add a new endpoint to our API.
```

### How it works

The AI agent will automatically follow the **command creation workflow** which guides it through:

1. **Understanding the process** - The agent identifies the development process you want to capture as a command
2. **Structuring the command** - The agent breaks down the process into clear, actionable steps with:
   - **When to use** scenarios - Specific situations where the command applies
   - **Context validation checkpoints** - Questions to clarify before implementing
   - **Step-by-step instructions** - Atomic, repeatable actions with optional code examples
3. **Finalization** - Once structured properly, the agent calls the `save_command` MCP tool

Your new command will be available in the Packmind web app, in the **Commands** panel.

<Tip>
  The workflow ensures commands are well-structured and reusable by enforcing
  clear steps, validation checkpoints, and usage scenarios. This makes them
  effective for AI agents and team members alike.

## Tips

The quality of the generated command depends mostly on the level of detail you provide to your coding assistant.

When capturing a **Command**, you can, for example:

- **Use the current conversation**

  **Example**

  ```text
  Create a Packmind command for adding a new endpoint based on your last suggested changes.
  ```

- **Mention example files or directories**

  **Example**

  ```text
  Using the file `MyPageFile.tsx`, create a Packmind command for bootstrapping a new page in the frontend.
  ```

- **Use a Git commit diff**

  **Example**

  ```text
  Read commit abcd123 and create a command for migrating an Angular component to React.
  ```
