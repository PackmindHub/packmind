title: 'Create your first command'
---

In teams using coding assistants, sharing and reusing _prompts that work_ is often tedious.

A Packmind **Command** is an executable, step-by-step guide that tells the AI assistant exactly how to perform a development task so your team's practices are applied consistently and reproducibly.

**Examples**

- “Add a new REST endpoint” — steps to define the route, implement the handler, add input validation, write tests, and update API docs.
- “Set up a CI pipeline for a project” — steps to configure the workflow, run lint/tests/build on each push/PR, and report status checks.

<Warning>
  The MCP server **must** be configured to create Commands. See the setup guide:
  [Get started with the MCP server](/getting-started/gs-mcp-server-setup).
</Warning>

## How to

1. Open your IDE and your coding assistant in **agentic mode**.
2. For this demo, we will create a **language-agnostic command**. (You can also target a specific language or framework.)
3. Type this prompt or use the `/packmind-create-command` skill:

```text
Analyze our codebase and create a Packmind command to add a new endpoint to our API.
```

<Tip>
  **Using the Skill** — You can also type `/packmind-create-command` in your AI
  assistant to invoke the command creator skill directly. This provides
  step-by-step guidance through the creation process.
</Tip>

### How it works

The AI agent will automatically follow the **command creation workflow** which guides it through:

1. **Understanding the process** - The agent identifies the development process you want to capture as a command
2. **Structuring the command** - The agent breaks down the process into clear, actionable steps with:
   - **When to use** scenarios - Specific situations where the command applies
   - **Context validation checkpoints** - Questions to clarify before implementing
   - **Step-by-step instructions** - Atomic, repeatable actions with optional code examples
3. **Finalization** - Once structured properly, the agent calls the `save_command` MCP tool

Your new command will be available in the Packmind web app, in the **Commands** panel.

<Tip>
  The workflow ensures commands are well-structured and reusable by enforcing
  clear steps, validation checkpoints, and usage scenarios. This makes them
  effective for AI agents and team members alike.
</Tip>

## Alternative: Create Commands from the CLI

You can also create commands directly from your terminal using the Packmind CLI without MCP support.

### Prerequisites

1. Install the Packmind CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @packmind/cli
```

2. Authenticate with your Packmind account:

```bash
packmind-cli login
```

### Create a Command File

Create a JSON file (e.g., `my-command.json`) with your command definition:

```json
{
  "name": "Add a New REST Endpoint",
  "summary": "Step-by-step guide for adding a new REST endpoint with validation, tests, and documentation",
  "whenToUse": [
    "When adding a new API endpoint to the backend service",
    "When extending existing API functionality"
  ],
  "contextValidationCheckpoints": [
    "Do you understand the business requirement?",
    "Do you know the request and response structures?"
  ],
  "steps": [
    {
      "name": "Define the Route",
      "description": "Create the HTTP route with appropriate method and path"
    },
    {
      "name": "Implement the Handler",
      "description": "Write the handler function that processes the request"
    },
    {
      "name": "Add Input Validation",
      "description": "Validate request parameters and body data"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Understanding Command Naming

The `name` field in your playbook is automatically converted to a **slug** for use in file names and AI agent invocation:

- **Your playbook name**: `"Add a New REST Endpoint"`
- **Generated slug**: `"add-a-new-rest-endpoint"`
- **Used in file**: `.claude/commands/packmind/add-a-new-rest-endpoint.md`
- **AI agent command**: `/add-a-new-rest-endpoint`

**Slug Generation Rules:**

- Converts to lowercase
- Replaces spaces and special characters with hyphens
- Removes non-alphanumeric characters
- If a command with the same slug exists, adds `-1`, `-2`, etc. for uniqueness

**Examples:**

- `"Setup CI Pipeline"` → `"setup-ci-pipeline"`
- `"Add@Database Migration!"` → `"add-database-migration"`
- Duplicate of above → `"add-database-migration-1"`

### Submit the Command

Run the CLI command to create the command:

```bash
packmind-cli commands create ./my-command.json
```

Your new command will appear in the Packmind web app's **Commands** panel.

<Tip>
  **CLI vs MCP Workflow** — Use the CLI approach when you already have a command
  structured and ready, or when you prefer working with files. Use the MCP/AI
  approach when you want AI assistance in analyzing your codebase and
  structuring the command.
</Tip>

## Tips

The quality of the generated command depends mostly on the level of detail you provide.

When capturing a **Command**, you can, for example:

- **Use the current conversation**

  **Example**

  ```text
  Create a Packmind command for adding a new endpoint based on your last suggested changes.
  ```

- **Mention example files or directories**

  **Example**

  ```text
  Using the file `MyPageFile.tsx`, create a Packmind command for bootstrapping a new page in the frontend.
  ```

- **Use a Git commit diff**

  **Example**

  ```text
  Read commit abcd123 and create a command for migrating an Angular component to React.
  ```

## What Makes a Good Command

- **Clear purpose** — The command name and summary clearly explain what it accomplishes
- **Realistic scenarios** — The "When to use" section covers actual situations your team encounters
- **Validation checkpoints** — Questions clarify prerequisites and assumptions
- **Actionable steps** — Each step is specific and can be completed independently
- **Helpful examples** — Code snippets demonstrate what to do, not just explain it
