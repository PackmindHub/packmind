title: 'Set Up Your Project with Onboarding'
---

## Overview

Packmind's onboarding skill automatically scans your project, detects your technologies and coding patterns, and generates tailored standards and commands. Instead of manually creating standards from scratch, your AI agent analyzes your existing code and practices to create a foundation you can refine.

This is the fastest way to get Packmind working in your project.

## Prerequisites

- Packmind CLI installed
- Logged in with `packmind-cli login`
- Packmind skills installed with `packmind-cli install`
- A Git repository in your project

## Quick Start

In your AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), invoke the onboarding skill:

```
/packmind-onboard
```

The skill guides you through an interactive process:

1. **Select analysis depth** — Quick scan or Optimal (deeper analysis)
2. **Create or select a package** — Where your standards and commands will be stored
3. **Analyze your codebase** — Read-only scan for patterns and conventions
4. **Review generated drafts** — Preview before creating anything
5. **Create standards and commands** — Publish to Packmind and deploy locally

## Analysis Modes

When you start onboarding, choose your analysis depth:

| Mode        | Checks            | Best For                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Quick**   | 4 pattern checks  | Fast starter set, small projects         |
| **Optimal** | 17 pattern checks | Comprehensive analysis, larger codebases |

Quick mode focuses on file templates, CI/local parity, role taxonomy, and test data patterns. Optimal mode adds cross-domain communication, module boundaries, error semantics, observability, and more.

## What Gets Generated

Based on your project's patterns, you'll get up to:

**Standards** (max 5 per run)

- Architectural patterns (module boundaries, cross-domain communication)
- Error handling conventions
- Test data construction patterns
- Authorization boundaries

**Commands** (max 5 per run)

- File template workflows
- CI/local development parity scripts
- Project-specific automation

All items are created as **drafts first** in `.packmind/standards/_drafts/` and `.packmind/commands/_drafts/`, giving you a chance to review and edit before publishing.

## The Onboarding Flow

### Step 1: Package Selection

The skill checks for existing packages:

- **No packages exist**: Automatically creates `{repo-name}-standards`
- **One package exists**: Asks if you want to use it or create a new one
- **Multiple packages**: Lists all options for you to choose

### Step 2: Codebase Analysis

The skill performs a read-only scan:

1. Detects your tech stack (languages, frameworks, architecture patterns)
2. Identifies existing Packmind/agent configuration
3. Runs pattern analysis based on your chosen mode
4. Collects evidence (file paths, line ranges) for each finding

### Step 3: Draft Review

After analysis, you see a summary:

```
DRAFTS CREATED:

Standards (3):
  1. Error Handling Pattern → .packmind/standards/_drafts/error-handling.draft.md
  2. Test Factory Pattern → .packmind/standards/_drafts/test-factory.draft.md
  3. Module Boundaries → .packmind/standards/_drafts/module-boundaries.draft.md

Commands (2):
  1. Run Full Test Suite → .packmind/commands/_drafts/run-tests.draft.md
  2. Create New Module → .packmind/commands/_drafts/create-module.draft.md
```

You can then choose:

- **Create all now** — Proceed with publishing
- **Let me review drafts first** — Edit the markdown files, then re-run the skill
- **Cancel** — Exit without creating anything

### Step 4: Publishing

When you confirm, the skill:

1. Converts each draft to JSON format
2. Creates standards via `packmind-cli standards create`
3. Creates commands via `packmind-cli commands create`
4. Adds each item to your package via `packmind-cli packages add`
5. Deploys locally via `packmind-cli install`

## After Onboarding

Once complete, your standards and commands are:

- **Published to Packmind** — Available in your organization
- **Added to your package** — Ready for team distribution
- **Deployed locally** — Active in your AI agent configuration

Files are written to agent-specific locations:

| Agent          | Standards                 | Commands                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Claude Code    | `.claude/rules/packmind/` | `.claude/commands/packmind/` |
| Cursor         | `.cursor/rules/packmind/` | `.cursor/commands/packmind/` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/instructions/`   | `.github/prompts/`           |

## Re-running Onboarding

Run the skill again anytime:

- After significant codebase changes
- To use Optimal mode after starting with Quick
- To generate additional standards and commands

The skill never overwrites existing artifacts. If a slug already exists, it creates `-2`, `-3`, etc.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Skill says I'm not logged in**

Run `packmind-cli login` first, then retry the skill.

**Q: Package creation fails**

Check your network connection and that you have permissions to create packages in your organization.

**Q: No patterns discovered**

Try running with Optimal mode for deeper analysis. Very new or small codebases may not have enough patterns to detect.

**Q: Generated standards don't match my project**

Onboarding generates a starting point. Edit the draft files in `.packmind/*/_drafts/` before confirming, or customize the published standards later.
