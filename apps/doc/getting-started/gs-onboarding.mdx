title: 'Set Up Your Project with Onboarding'
---

## Overview

Packmind automatically generates coding standards and commands from your project. Instead of manually creating standards from scratch, your AI agent analyzes your existing code and practices to create a foundation you can refine.

## Skill-Based Onboarding

The `/packmind-onboard` skill provides automated batch analysis of your codebase, generating both standards and commands.

### Prerequisites

- Packmind CLI installed
- Logged in with `packmind-cli login`
- Packmind skills installed with `packmind-cli init`
- A Git repository in your project

### Quick Start

In your AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), invoke the onboarding skill:

```
/packmind-onboard
```

The skill guides you through an interactive process:

1. **Create or select a package** — Where your standards and commands will be stored
2. **Analyze your codebase** — Read-only scan for patterns and conventions
3. **Review generated drafts** — Preview before creating anything
4. **Create standards and commands** — Publish to Packmind and deploy locally

### What Gets Generated

Based on your project's patterns, you'll get up to:

**Standards** (max 5 per run)

- Role taxonomy drift patterns
- Test data construction patterns

**Commands** (max 5 per run)

- File template workflows
- CI/local development parity scripts

All items are created as **drafts first**, giving you a chance to review and edit before publishing.

### The Onboarding Flow

#### Step 1: Package Selection

The skill checks for existing packages:

- **No packages exist**: Automatically creates `{repo-name}-standards`
- **One package exists**: Asks if you want to use it or create a new one
- **Multiple packages**: Lists all options for you to choose

#### Step 2: Codebase Analysis

The skill performs a read-only scan of your project, detecting your tech stack, frameworks, and coding patterns.

#### Step 3: Draft Review

After analysis, you see a summary of what will be created (e.g., "3 standards, 2 commands"). You can then choose:

- **Create all now** — Publish everything to Packmind
- **Let me review drafts first** — Edit the drafts before publishing
- **Cancel** — Exit without creating anything

#### Step 4: Publishing

When you confirm, the skill publishes everything to Packmind and deploys to your local AI agent automatically.

### After Skill-Based Onboarding

Once complete, your standards and commands are:

- **Published to Packmind** — Available in your organization
- **Added to your package** — Ready for team distribution
- **Deployed locally** — Active in your AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

### Re-running Skill-Based Onboarding

Run the skill again anytime to generate additional standards and commands. The skill never overwrites existing items.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Skill says I'm not logged in**

Run `packmind-cli login` first, then retry the skill.

**Q: Package creation fails**

Check your network connection and that you have permissions to create packages in your organization.

**Q: No patterns discovered**

Very new or small codebases may not have enough patterns to detect. Try running the skill again after adding more code to your project.

**Q: Generated standards don't match my project**

Onboarding generates a starting point. Edit draft files before confirming to customize them to your needs.
