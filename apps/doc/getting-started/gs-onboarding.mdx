title: 'Set Up Your Project with Onboarding'
---

## Overview

Packmind offers two ways to automatically generate coding standards from your project. Instead of manually creating standards from scratch, your AI agent analyzes your existing code and practices to create a foundation you can refine.

## Choose Your Approach

| Approach                                   | Best For                   | Creates              | How It Works                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **[Skill-based](#skill-based-onboarding)** | Batch analysis, CLI users  | Standards + Commands | Automated scan with draft review          |
| **[MCP-based](#mcp-based-onboarding)**     | Guided creation, MCP users | Standards only       | Interactive workflow with topic selection |

**Use skill-based onboarding** if you have Packmind skills installed (Claude Code, Cursor with skills) and want automated batch analysis.

**Use MCP-based onboarding** if you're using the Packmind MCP server (Claude Desktop, other MCP clients) and want a guided, focused workflow.

## Skill-Based Onboarding

The `/packmind-onboard` skill provides automated batch analysis of your codebase, generating both standards and commands.

### Prerequisites

- Packmind CLI installed
- Logged in with `packmind-cli login`
- Packmind skills installed with `packmind-cli init`
- A Git repository in your project

### Quick Start

In your AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), invoke the onboarding skill:

```
/packmind-onboard
```

The skill guides you through an interactive process:

1. **Create or select a package** — Where your standards and commands will be stored
2. **Analyze your codebase** — Read-only scan for patterns and conventions
3. **Review generated drafts** — Preview before creating anything
4. **Create standards and commands** — Publish to Packmind and deploy locally

### What Gets Generated

Based on your project's patterns, you'll get up to:

**Standards** (max 5 per run)

- Role taxonomy drift patterns
- Test data construction patterns

**Commands** (max 5 per run)

- File template workflows
- CI/local development parity scripts

All items are created as **drafts first**, giving you a chance to review and edit before publishing.

### The Onboarding Flow

#### Step 1: Package Selection

The skill checks for existing packages:

- **No packages exist**: Automatically creates `{repo-name}-standards`
- **One package exists**: Asks if you want to use it or create a new one
- **Multiple packages**: Lists all options for you to choose

#### Step 2: Codebase Analysis

The skill performs a read-only scan of your project, detecting your tech stack, frameworks, and coding patterns.

#### Step 3: Draft Review

After analysis, you see a summary of what will be created (e.g., "3 standards, 2 commands"). You can then choose:

- **Create all now** — Publish everything to Packmind
- **Let me review drafts first** — Edit the drafts before publishing
- **Cancel** — Exit without creating anything

#### Step 4: Publishing

When you confirm, the skill publishes everything to Packmind and deploys to your local AI agent automatically.

### After Skill-Based Onboarding

Once complete, your standards and commands are:

- **Published to Packmind** — Available in your organization
- **Added to your package** — Ready for team distribution
- **Deployed locally** — Active in your AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

### Re-running Skill-Based Onboarding

Run the skill again anytime to generate additional standards and commands. The skill never overwrites existing items.

## MCP-Based Onboarding

The MCP `onboarding` tool provides guided workflows for creating standards one at a time, with multiple analysis methods to choose from.

### Prerequisites

- Packmind MCP server configured (see [MCP Server Setup](/getting-started/gs-mcp-server-setup))
- An MCP-compatible AI client (Claude Desktop, etc.)

### Quick Start

Ask your AI agent to help you create standards:

```
Help me create coding standards for my project
```

The AI agent will present five analysis methods:

1. **📁 Codebase Analysis** — Analyze your current codebase to identify languages, frameworks, and patterns
2. **📈 Git History Analysis** — Analyze recent commits to identify areas where standards could help
3. **📄 Documentation Analysis** — Convert existing markdown docs, ADRs, and guidelines into standards
4. **🤖 AI Instructions Analysis** — Transform existing AI agent instructions (CLAUDE.md, .cursor/rules) into standards
5. **🌐 Web Research** — Research industry best practices for specific technologies

### How MCP Onboarding Works

Each method follows the same general flow:

1. **Analysis** — The AI examines your chosen source (code, commits, docs, etc.)
2. **Topic Selection** — You're presented with relevant areas and pick one to focus on
3. **Deep Dive** — The AI analyzes your chosen topic thoroughly
4. **Standard Creation** — Creates one standard with 5 actionable rules
5. **Package Selection** — Optionally adds the standard to a package

### Analysis Methods in Detail

#### Codebase Analysis

The AI scans your project and identifies up to 10 areas where standards would help:

```
I've analyzed your codebase and identified these key areas:

1. TypeScript - Used throughout with strict mode enabled
2. React - Component patterns in src/components/
3. Jest - Unit testing with specific mocking patterns
4. Express - REST API with middleware patterns
...

Which area would you like me to focus on?
```

After you select a topic, the AI creates a standard based on actual patterns found in your code.

#### Git History Analysis

Examines your last 30 commits to find recurring patterns or areas with frequent changes:

```
Based on your recent commits, I identified these areas:

1. Error handling - 8 commits touched error handling code
2. API response formatting - Consistent patterns emerging
3. Test organization - Recent restructuring patterns
...
```

#### Documentation Analysis

Scans markdown files including ADRs, README files, and existing guidelines to convert documented decisions into enforceable standards.

#### AI Instructions Analysis

Reads existing AI agent configuration files:

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `copilot-instructions.md`
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`

Converts these informal instructions into structured Packmind standards.

#### Web Research

For technologies where you want industry best practices rather than project-specific patterns. The AI researches authoritative sources and creates standards based on community consensus.

### What Gets Generated

Each MCP onboarding session creates:

- **1 standard** focused on your selected topic
- **5 rules** per standard, each with positive and negative code examples
- **Optional package assignment** if packages exist in your organization

### After MCP-Based Onboarding

The standard is immediately available in your Packmind organization. To deploy it locally:

```bash
packmind-cli install
```

Or ask your AI agent to install the package containing your new standard.

## Comparing the Approaches

| Feature                | Skill-Based                    | MCP-Based                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Automation level**   | High (batch processing)        | Interactive (guided)        |
| **Output per session** | Up to 5 standards + 5 commands | 1 standard with 5 rules     |
| **Analysis methods**   | Quick or Optimal scan          | 5 specialized methods       |
| **Draft review**       | Yes, before publishing         | No, creates directly        |
| **Commands support**   | Yes                            | No (standards only)         |
| **Package handling**   | Required, with auto-creation   | Optional, suggests matches  |
| **Best for**           | Initial project setup          | Focused, iterative creation |

**Tip:** Use skill-based onboarding for initial project setup, then use MCP-based onboarding to add focused standards for specific areas over time.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Skill says I'm not logged in**

Run `packmind-cli login` first, then retry the skill.

**Q: MCP tool not found**

Ensure your MCP server is configured correctly. See [MCP Server Setup](/getting-started/gs-mcp-server-setup).

**Q: Package creation fails**

Check your network connection and that you have permissions to create packages in your organization.

**Q: No patterns discovered**

Try running with Optimal mode (skill) or a different analysis method (MCP). Very new or small codebases may not have enough patterns to detect.

**Q: Generated standards don't match my project**

Onboarding generates a starting point. For skill-based, edit draft files before confirming. For MCP-based, customize the standard after creation or use a different analysis method.
