## What's Packmind

Packmind is a developer tool that fixes two big problems every AI-native engineer runs into:

### **1️⃣ “What do I even put in these AI instructions?”**

Every tool expects its own inputs:

- **Copilot** → `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, chat modes, reusable prompts
- **Claude** → `CLAUDE.md`, commands, skills
- **Cursor** → `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
- **Kiro** → `.kiro/steering/*.md`
- _(with more formats appearing every month…)_

But your team’s **actual standards aren’t stored anywhere**:

- architecture rules → buried in Slack or Notion
- naming conventions → stuck in your head
- patterns → hiding in PR comments
- best practices → scattered across repos

👉 **Packmind helps you turn all of this into a real engineering playbook**  
(standards, commands, skills) so **AI agents finally code _your way_.**

---

### **2️⃣ “Why am I copy-pasting this across every repo and every agent?”**

Every repo.  
Every assistant.  
Different files, different folders, different formats.

Keeping everything in sync is impossible.

👉 **Packmind centralizes your playbook once — and distributes it everywhere**,
generating the exact instruction files each AI tool needs, optimized for context.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **[Create your Packmind account](./getting-started/gs-install-cloud)** or **[set up self-hosted](./getting-started/gs-install-self-hosted)**
2. **[Install the CLI](./getting-started/gs-cli-setup)** and authenticate
3. Run `/packmind-onboard` in your AI coding assistant

The `/packmind-onboard` command will guide your AI agent to automatically analyze your codebase and create standards and commands based on the patterns it discovers.

### What Happens During Onboarding

When you run `/packmind-onboard`, the AI agent will:

- 📁 **Scan your repository** — Detect tech stack, frameworks, and coding patterns
- 📝 **Generate standards** — Create up to 5 coding standards from your conventions
- ⚡ **Create commands** — Build up to 5 reusable commands from common workflows
- 📦 **Package everything** — Organize artifacts for easy distribution

All generated items are created as drafts first, giving you a chance to review before publishing.

### Create Individual Artifacts

You can also create standards, commands, and skills individually using these AI agent commands:

- **`/packmind-create-standard`** — Create a coding standard with AI guidance
- **`/packmind-create-command`** — Create a reusable command workflow
- **`/packmind-create-skill`** — Create a custom skill for your AI agents

Each command guides your AI agent through a structured creation process.
