title: 'Manage AI Agent Rendering'
---

## Overview

Organization administrators can control which AI coding assistants receive your standards and commands when you distribute them to Git repositories. This allows you to distribute only the formats your team actually uses.

<Info title="Only users with **Admin** privileges can configure AI agent rendering. If you need to change this configuration, contact your organization administrator.">

</Info>

## Configuring AI Agents

To configure which agents are enabled:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Distribution** → **Rendering**
2. Toggle on the agents you want to use
3. Click **Save Changes**

When you distribute standards or commands, only the enabled agents will have their instruction files updated in your Git repositories.
