Now that Packmind contains coding standards, commands, and skills, let's distribute them to your Git Repositories.

The distribution will commit instructions files that will be used by AI Agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

## Supported AI Agents

Packmind supports multiple AI coding assistants. Organization administrators can choose which agents to enable in **Settings** → **Distribution** → **Rendering**. See [Manage AI Agent Rendering](/administration/manage-ai-agents) for details.

Here is an overview of the supported agents:

| AI Agent           | What It Does                     | File Location                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Packmind**       | Internal renderer (required)     | `.packmind/`                      |
| **AGENTS.md**      | Updates instructions file        | `AGENTS.md`                       |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Updates instructions file        | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| **Cursor**         | Creates rules in YAML format     | `.cursor/rules/`                  |
| **Claude Code**    | Updates instructions file        | `CLAUDE.md`                       |
| **Junie**          | Updates guidelines file          | `.junie/guidelines.md`            |
| **Gitlab Duo**     | Updates chat rules file          | `.gitlab/duo/chat-rules.md`       |
| **Continue**       | Creates rules in Markdown format | `.continue/rules/packmind/`       |

When you distribute standards, commands, or skills, only the enabled agents will receive updates. The Packmind renderer is always active and creates files in the `.packmind/` directory that are used by other agents.

For detailed information about where your artifacts appear and how to use them with each AI assistant, see [Understanding Where Your Artifacts Appear](/concepts/artifact-rendering).

  **Need support for a new AI agent?** You can create an issue in our
  [repository](https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind) to request support for
  additional AI coding assistants.

## How to Distribute

There are three ways to distribute packages to your repositories:

1. **Using the Packmind app** - Distribute packages through the web interface with full control over targets and repositories
2. **Using packmind-cli** - Install packages directly from your terminal, useful for CI/CD pipelines and local development
3. **Using the MCP tool** - Install packages directly from AI agents that support MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### Distribution Methods Overview

| Method  | Best For                                    | Git Provider Management                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **App** | Centralized distribution, team coordination | Full control via connected Git providers |
| **CLI** | CI/CD pipelines, local development          | Creates read-only provider entries       |
| **MCP** | AI-assisted development, agent workflows    | Creates read-only provider entries       |

## Distribute via the App

To distribute standards, commands, and skills, you need to add them to a package.

A package is a curated collection of commands, standards, and skills grouped together (e.g., "Frontend React Standards", "Backend API Guidelines"). When you distribute a package:

- All commands, standards, and skills in the package are distributed together
- The latest version of each item is used
- A single commit contains all the package content
- You can distribute multiple packages at once to the same target

To distribute packages:

1. Navigate to the **Packages** section
2. Select the package(s) you want to distribute
3. Click **Distribute** and choose your target repositories
4. Confirm the Distribution

This approach is useful when you want to:

- Distribute related guidelines together
- Maintain consistent sets of standards across projects
- Organize guidelines by technology, team, or project structure

For more information on creating and managing packages, see [Packages Management](/concepts/packages-management).

## Distribute via packmind-cli

You can also distribute packages directly from your terminal using the `packmind-cli` command:

```bash
packmind-cli install <package-slug>
```

For example:

```bash
packmind-cli install backend-standards frontend-react
```

This will:

1. Fetch the specified packages from Packmind
2. Generate the instruction files for all enabled AI agents
3. Write the files to your local repository
4. Notify Packmind that a distribution occurred

### CLI Distribution Considerations

When you distribute packages using the CLI, Packmind automatically creates a Git provider entry to track the distribution. However, these CLI-created providers have some limitations:

<Warning>
  **Limited Provider Management** — Git providers created through CLI
  distributions do not have an associated token. This means you cannot trigger
  new distributions from the app for these repositories, you cannot add new
  targets to these providers from the app, and the provider appears in your
  organization's Git settings but with limited functionality. To enable full
  management from the app, connect a Git provider with a valid token in
  **Settings** → **Git Providers**.
</Warning>

### When to Use CLI Distribution

The CLI approach is ideal for:

- **CI/CD pipelines** - Automate distribution as part of your deployment process
- **Local development** - Quickly install packages without leaving your terminal
- **Monorepos** - Use `packmind-cli install --recursive` to install packages for all `packmind.json` files in the repository
- **Self-hosted Git instances** - Distribute to repositories that aren't connected to the app

## Distribute via MCP Tool

If you're using an AI agent that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) and have the Packmind MCP server configured, you can install packages directly through your AI assistant using the `install_package` tool.

### How It Works

The MCP tool provides a two-step installation process:

1. **Get installation instructions** - Call `install_package` with your package slugs to receive the list of file updates needed
2. **Apply the changes** - The AI agent applies the file updates to your repository

### Usage

Ask your AI assistant to install Packmind packages. For example:

> "Install the backend-standards package from Packmind"

The AI agent will:

1. Call the `install_package` MCP tool with the specified package slugs
2. Receive the file contents for all enabled AI agent renderers
3. Write or update the instruction files in your repository
4. Notify Packmind that a distribution occurred

### MCP Distribution Considerations

Similar to CLI distributions, MCP-based distributions create Git provider entries with limited functionality:

<Warning>
  **Limited Provider Management** — Git providers created through MCP
  distributions do not have an associated token. This means you cannot trigger
  new distributions from the app for these repositories, you cannot add new
  targets to these providers from the app, and the provider appears in your
  organization's Git settings but with limited functionality. To enable full
  management from the app, connect a Git provider with a valid token in
  **Settings** → **Git Providers**.
</Warning>

### When to Use MCP Distribution

The MCP approach is ideal for:

- **AI-assisted development** - Let your AI coding assistant manage package installation as part of your workflow
- **Interactive setup** - Get guidance and validation from your AI agent during installation
- **Quick iterations** - Update packages without switching context from your AI chat interface
- **Onboarding new projects** - Have your AI assistant set up Packmind standards in new repositories

## Removing Packages

When you no longer need a package in your repository, you can remove it using either the app or the CLI.

### Remove via the App

In the Packmind app, you can remove packages one-by-one from your distributions:

1. Navigate to the **Packages** section
2. Open the package you want to remove
3. Click **Remove from target** and confirm the removal

### Remove via the CLI

There are two ways to remove packages using the CLI:

**Option 1: Use the remove command**

```bash
packmind-cli remove <package-slug>
```

For example:

```bash
packmind-cli remove backend-standards
```

**Option 2: Edit packmind.json and reinstall**

1. Open your `packmind.json` file
2. Remove the package slug from the packages list
3. Run the install command to update your repository:

```bash
packmind-cli install
```

This approach is useful when you want to make multiple changes to your package configuration at once.
