## With Docker Compose[​](#with-docker-compose 'Direct link to With Docker Compose')

For Linux and MacOS users, run this script to create a `./packmind` folder with a Docker Compose setup inside:

```
mkdir packmind && \cd packmind && \curl -fsSL -o install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PackmindHub/packmind/refs/heads/main/dockerfile/prod/setup-packmind-compose.sh && \chmod +x install.sh && \./install.sh
```

Once this command is executed, Packmind is now available at [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/), and you can start using it right away.

Update later with `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

## With Helm on Kubernetes[​](#with-helm-on-kubernetes 'Direct link to With Helm on Kubernetes')

Get started on the [Helm Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind-ai-helm-chart) to deploy Packmind on Kubernetes.

## Connect your LLM (Optional but important)[​](#connect-your-llm-optional-but-important 'Direct link to Connect your LLM (Optional but important)')

Connecting a LLM offers a better experience when distributing your standards and commands in your Git Repositories, while it's _not mandatory_ and you can use Packmind without this.

_OpenAI_ is the only currently supported AI Provider.

If you use Docker Compose, you'll have to update the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```
x-openai-config: &openai-config  OPENAI_API_KEY: <YOUR_KEY>
```

Restart then with:

```
docker compose up -d
```

## Add custom CA certificates (Docker Compose)[​](#add-custom-ca-certificates-docker-compose 'Direct link to Add custom CA certificates (Docker Compose)')

If your infrastructure uses self-signed certificates or custom Certificate Authorities (CA), you can configure Packmind to trust them:

1. Create a `certs` directory next to your `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```
   mkdir certs
   ```

2. Place your CA certificate(s) in PEM format as `certs/ca-bundle.pem`:

   ```
   # For a single certificatecp your-ca-cert.pem certs/ca-bundle.pem# For multiple certificates, combine themcat cert1.pem cert2.pem > certs/ca-bundle.pem
   ```

3. Edit `docker-compose.yml` and uncomment the certificate lines in both `api` and `mcp-server` services:

   ```
   api:  environment:    NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS: /ca-certs/ca-bundle.pem # Uncomment this line  volumes:    - ./certs/ca-bundle.pem:/ca-certs/ca-bundle.pem:ro # Uncomment these 2 linesmcp-server:  environment:    NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS: /ca-certs/ca-bundle.pem # Uncomment this line  volumes:    - ./certs/ca-bundle.pem:/ca-certs/ca-bundle.pem:ro # Uncomment these 2 lines
   ```

4. Restart the services:

   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Configure deployment and environment variables[​](#configure-deployment-and-environment-variables 'Direct link to Configure deployment and environment variables')

### Override environment variables[​](#override-environment-variables 'Direct link to Override environment variables')

#### With Docker Compose[​](#with-docker-compose-1 'Direct link to With Docker Compose')

You can override both `api` and `mcp` sections of the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

Here is an example of how to add the `SMTP_FROM` variable to Docker Compose.

```
  api:    image: packmind/api:${PACKMIND_TAG:-latest}    container_name: packmind-api    ports:      - '3000:3000'    environment:      <<: [*database-url, *redis-config, *openai-config]      SMTP_FROM: username@acme.org
```

#### With Helm Chart[​](#with-helm-chart 'Direct link to With Helm Chart')

Follow the instructions on the [Helm Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind-ai-helm-chart) on how the YAML values file.
