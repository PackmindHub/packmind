## Getting Your MCP Access Token[​](#getting-your-mcp-access-token 'Direct link to Getting Your MCP Access Token')

1. Go into **Account Settings** in Packmind
2. Get your MCP Access token

## Configuring Your AI Agent[​](#configuring-your-ai-agent 'Direct link to Configuring Your AI Agent')

Once you have your MCP access token, you can configure your AI agent to connect to Packmind. The specific configuration steps depend on which AI agent you're using (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.).

Your AI agent will need:

- The MCP server URL (typically `{PACKMIND_URL}/mcp`)
- Your MCP access token

## Using the MCP Server[​](#using-the-mcp-server 'Direct link to Using the MCP Server')

Once configured, you can use MCP commands directly in your AI agent conversations to:

- Create standards
- Add rules to existing standards
- Create commands from your workflow

See the [Standards Management](/standards-management) and [Commands Management](/commands-management) sections for specific usage examples.
