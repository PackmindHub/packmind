Understand your responsibilities and control over data when running Packmind on your own infrastructure.

## Overview

When you install Packmind on your own servers, **you have complete control over your data**. Nothing is sent to Packmind's cloud services. This page explains what this means for you and what you're responsible for managing.

For information about Packmind Cloud security and privacy, see [Security & Privacy](/security/security-privacy).

## Your Data Control

### Complete Local Control

When you run Packmind on your infrastructure:

- **All your data stays local** - Nothing is sent to Packmind's cloud application
- **You control everything** - Your database, backups, and all data remain within your infrastructure
- **Air-gapped deployments supported** - You can run Packmind entirely offline within your local network

### No Data Sharing with Packmind

Packmind has **no access** to your self-hosted installation:

- We cannot see what you do in your Packmind instance
- We do not have access to your database or any operational data
- All your data remains entirely within your infrastructure

## Your Responsibilities

When you run Packmind self-hosted, you are responsible for:

### Data Backups

You must create and maintain your own backup strategy. Packmind does not automatically back up your data.

### Data Encryption

You are responsible for encrypting your data:

- Data stored in your database (encryption at rest)
- Data transmitted between services (encryption in transit)

### Database Security

You manage and secure your database. This includes:

- Setting strong passwords
- Controlling who has access
- Keeping your database updated

### Network Security

You control:

- Who can access your Packmind instance
- Firewall rules and network isolation
- How services communicate within your network

### API Keys and Credentials

You manage all secrets and credentials:

- API keys for AI providers
- Access tokens for Git repositories
- Database passwords and other credentials

### Monitoring and Maintenance

You are responsible for:

- Monitoring your Packmind instance
- Keeping components updated
- Reviewing logs for issues

## Connecting External Services

### Git Repositories

When you connect GitLab, GitHub, or other Git repositories:

- All repository data stays on your infrastructure
- No repository information is sent to Packmind servers
- You control all access tokens and credentials
- Everything happens within your network

### AI Providers

When you connect AI providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Azure OpenAI:

- You use **your own API keys** - Packmind never sees these credentials
- You are responsible for reviewing each provider's:
  - Data processing and retention policies
  - Terms of service
  - Privacy policies
  - Compliance certifications (if needed for your use case)
- All API calls go directly from your infrastructure to your chosen provider

## Air-Gapped Deployments

You can run Packmind in environments with no internet connection:

- The application runs entirely within your local network
- No connection to external Packmind services is needed
- All functionality works offline
- You can deploy using Docker Compose or Kubernetes in your isolated network

To deploy in an air-gapped environment, ensure you have all required components available locally before starting the installation.

## Data Retention

You have complete control over how long to keep your data:

- You decide when to delete data
- You set your own retention policies
- Packmind does not automatically delete any data

## Compliance

When running Packmind self-hosted:

- You are responsible for meeting compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)
- Packmind's SOC 2 Type II certification applies to the cloud version only
- You must implement and maintain your own compliance measures
- All data processing happens within your infrastructure under your control

## Open Source Transparency

Packmind is open source, which means you can:

- Review the code to understand exactly what it does
- Verify how your data is handled
- Customize the deployment for your security needs
- Contribute improvements to the project
