## Overview

This document provides comprehensive information about how Packmind handles data, implements security measures, and integrates with AI services. **This page is dedicated mainly to the Cloud version**.

For information about security and privacy in self-hosted and on-premise deployments, please see [Security & Privacy (Self-Hosted)](/security/security-privacy-self-hosted).

## Data Handling

### Functional Data (Business Content)

Packmind stores information necessary for building the **Engineering Playbook** used by AI agents:

- **Coding rule descriptions**
  - Text describing best practices
  - Code snippets illustrating:
    - Correct implementation
    - Incorrect practices
- This data originates from **the client's codebase** and is generated manually by users.

### Personal Data

Packmind stores **only** the following personal data:

- **Email address** of the user (for authentication)

### External Service Credentials

Stored only if the client configures these integrations:

- GitHub / GitLab connection information (access tokens)
- LLM provider access keys, including:
  - OpenAI
  - Anthropic
  - Azure OpenAI
- These credentials enable advanced features related to AI agents.

Packmind **never uses** this data for any other internal purposes.

## Data Origin & Authentication

### Data Source

All data comes from **the client environment**:

- Users provide data to Packmind via the **CLI or AI coding assistants**
- No automated or bulk imports (e.g., CSV) are performed
- All data is transmitted **manually, voluntarily, and intentionally**

### Authentication

- Each user must individually authenticate to Packmind
- Web interface authentication uses username/password (SSO available Q1 2026)

## Data Retention & Storage

### Retention Policy

- Data is retained **as long as the client organization is active on the cloud platform**
- Data can be permanently deleted upon request
- In self-hosted deployments, the client has full control over retention

### Architecture & Deployment

Packmind offers two deployment modes:

#### Cloud Mode (Hosted by Packmind)

- Infrastructure on **Microsoft Azure AKS** (Kubernetes)
- Hosting in **France region**
- Database, backups, and replications located **only in Europe**
- Deployment planned soon in a **US region**

#### Self-Hosted Mode

- Deployment options:
  - via Docker Compose
  - via Kubernetes (open source Helm chart)
- The client becomes responsible for:
  - network and isolation
  - secret management
  - monitoring

## Security Measures

### Encryption

- **TLS 1.3** for all traffic in transit on the Cloud platform
- **AES 256** encryption at rest for all data
- **AES 256** encryption for database backups

### Compliance

Packmind is certified **SOC 2 Type II**. Feel free to contact us to request a copy of the report at contact_at_packmind.com.

### Personal Data Requests

Packmind only stores email addresses as personal information. Reach us at dpo_at_packmind.com if you have any request regarding your current personal data we own, or any deletion request.

## AI & LLM Integration

### Default Provider

By default, Packmind uses **OpenAI** as the LLM provider for all organizations. You can configure your own LLM provider.

### Data Privacy & Usage

- **Training**: Your data is **not used by OpenAI for training any models**
- **Storage by OpenAI**: LLM prompts and responses are **not stored by OpenAI**
- **Storage by Packmind**: Inputs/outputs from models may be stored by Packmind for:
  - Observability
  - Analysis
  - Quality improvement of use cases
- **Metadata**: Only metadata such as the number of input and output tokens is stored

### No Internal AI Model Development

- Packmind **does not develop its own AI models**
- Client data:
  - is never used to train models
  - does not serve to build internal datasets
  - is not transmitted to third parties for AI usage

### AI Interaction Nature

- Uses **completion endpoints** (prompt / sequences of prompts)
- Does **not** use:
  - Vector storage
  - Embeddings
  - Vector databases

## Protocols & Security

- All communications use the **HTTPS** protocol
- Infrastructure is secured and monitored via Azure
- Packmind code is **open source** to allow auditing of behavior
