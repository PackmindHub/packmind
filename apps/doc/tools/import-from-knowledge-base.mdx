## Why import from your knowledge base?

Teams often have coding guidelines, conventions, and processes documented in wikis and knowledge bases. With MCP, your AI coding assistant can read directly from these sources and create Packmind artifacts — Standards, Commands, and Skills — without copy-pasting or rewriting content manually.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that lets AI agents connect to external data sources. Packmind leverages MCP to import content from any compatible knowledge base.

## Supported knowledge bases

Any tool that exposes an MCP server works with this workflow. Here are two popular options:

- **Confluence** — Follow the [Atlassian MCP server setup guide](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-rovo-mcp-server/docs/getting-started-with-the-atlassian-remote-mcp-server/) to connect your Confluence workspace.
- **Notion** — Follow the [Notion MCP setup guide](https://developers.notion.com/guides/mcp/get-started-with-mcp.md) to connect your Notion workspace.

Once MCP is configured in your AI coding assistant, Packmind can access your knowledge base pages directly.

## Demo

Here is an example of importing coding guidelines from Confluence into Packmind:

<iframe
  src="https://demo.arcade.software/wvhmovpiagPhl7p7nwM6?embed&embed_mobile=tab&embed_desktop=inline&show_copy_link=true"
  className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
  style={{
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',
    colorScheme: 'light',
  }}
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>

## What you can import

From your knowledge base pages, you can create three types of Packmind artifacts:

- **Standards** — Convert coding guidelines and conventions pages into enforceable standards that AI agents follow when generating code. Use the `/packmind-create-standard` skill to create one.
- **Commands** — Turn step-by-step process documentation into reusable commands that automate multi-step workflows. Use the `/packmind-create-command` skill to create one.
- **Skills** — Create skills from pages containing relevant domain knowledge that enriches AI agent capabilities. Use the `/packmind-create-skill` skill to create one.
