## Standard: [E2E] Page object

Define Playwright E2E PageObjects for each frontend route using regexp-based expectedUrl matching and mandatory this.pageFactory() after navigation to ensure safer URL validation and proper typing. :
* Always add this.pageFactory() after navigating to ensure proper typing
* Each route in the frontend should correspond to a Page object
* Use regExp for `expectedUrl` to ensure safer matching (better than the simili-glob of Playwright)
