# Packmind Standards Index

This standards index contains all available coding standards that can be used by AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to find and apply proven practices in coding tasks.

## Available Standards

- [[E2E] Page object](./standards/e2e-page-object.md) : Define Playwright E2E PageObjects for each frontend route using regexp-based expectedUrl matching and mandatory this.pageFactory() after navigation to ensure safer URL validation and proper typing.
- [[E2E] Writing E2E tests](./standards/e2e-writing-e2e-tests.md) : Define modular Playwright E2E test specs using shared fixtures (testWithApi, testWithUser) and API-based data factories to isolate feature behavior, reduce duplication, and improve test reliability.
