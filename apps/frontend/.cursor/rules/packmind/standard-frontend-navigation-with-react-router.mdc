## Standard: Frontend Navigation with React Router

Standardize frontend navigation using React Router v7 with centralized utilities in React applications to ensure consistent URL parameter handling and simplify navigation management, particularly when organizing and scoping URLs, across apps/frontend/**/*.tsx. :
* Omit orgSlug and spaceSlug parameters to use current organization and space context by default and only specify them explicitly when navigating to a different organization or space.
* Use authentication route methods (routes.auth.*) for authentication-related navigation.
* Use organization-scoped route methods (routes.org.*) for pages that require only organization context.
* Use space-scoped route methods (routes.space.*) for pages that require both organization and space context.
* Use the routes utility from shared/utils/routes for all declarative navigation with Link and NavLink components.
* Use the useNavigation() hook from shared/hooks/useNavigation for all programmatic navigation with navigate().
