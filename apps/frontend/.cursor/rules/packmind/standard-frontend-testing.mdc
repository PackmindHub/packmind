## Standard: Frontend testing

Enforce behavioral tests for components in files matching **/*.test.tsx using Jest and React Testing Library to assert functionality (e.g., that a button triggers the expected action) rather than mere presence, improving test reliability and preventing regressions. :
* Do not write test checking if a button is there, check that it actually works as expected
