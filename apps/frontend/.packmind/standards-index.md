# Packmind Standards Index

This standards index contains all available coding standards that can be used by AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to find and apply proven practices in coding tasks.

## Available Standards

- [Chakra UI v3 Component Composition and Styling](./standards/chakra-ui-v3-component-composition-and-styling.md) : Establish consistent Chakra UI v3 usage patterns for component composition, styling, theming, and layout structure in Next.js React applications
- [Frontend Data Flow](./standards/frontend-data-flow.md) : Define a React Router v7 framework-mode data flow using clientLoader with TanStack Query (queryClient.ensureQueryData/fetchQuery, domain-organized query options and hooks, and useLoaderData) to centralize route-level data fetching, reduce intermediate loading states, and promote reusable, well-typed gateway access patterns.
- [Frontend Error Management](./standards/frontend-error-management.md) : Establish frontend error management for apps/frontend/**/*.tsx that prescribes when to add React error boundaries beyond the global root.tsx fallback and how to handle errors they don't catch—such as event handlers, async code, SSR, or errors thrown in the boundary—by using TypeScript-typed guards (e.g., isPackmindError), try/catch for async operations, TanStack Query onError callbacks and mutation-pending checks to prevent double submissions, inline validation for expected API/user errors, and selective page- or component-level boundaries for isolated third-party widgets like CodeMirror, to reduce complexity, improve UX, and keep error flows maintainable in React/TypeScript projects built with Node.js and typical tooling (Vite/Webpack, ESLint/Prettier) and tested with Jest/Cypress.
- [Frontend Navigation with React Router](./standards/frontend-navigation-with-react-router.md) : Standardize frontend navigation using React Router v7 with centralized utilities in React applications to ensure consistent URL parameter handling and simplify navigation management, particularly when organizing and scoping URLs, across apps/frontend/**/*.tsx.
- [Frontend Routing and Bundling](./standards/frontend-routing-and-bundling.md) : Configure frontend routing and bundling to ensure React Router v7 routes are correctly grouped and bundled via Vite's rollupOptions.output.manualChunks in apps/frontend/vite.config.ts using id.includes() path matching to emit named chunks (routes-public-auth, routes-org-analytics, routes-org-settings, routes-org-artifacts) for public auth, org analytics/deployments/account settings, org settings, and artifacts to optimize code splitting, minimize bundle sizes, and improve loading performance in TypeScript React applications.
- [Frontend testing](./standards/frontend-testing.md) : Enforce behavioral tests for components in files matching **/*.test.tsx using Jest and React Testing Library to assert functionality (e.g., that a button triggers the expected action) rather than mere presence, improving test reliability and preventing regressions.
- [Jest Test Suite Organization and Patterns](./standards/jest-test-suite-organization-and-patterns.md) : Establish Jest test suite organization and patterns governing test file structure, describe/it hierarchy, typed mocking using jest.Mocked<ServiceType> and createMockInstance, factory-based test data and @packmind/types createUserId/createOrganizationId/createStandardId helpers, assertion conventions (single primary assertion, .not.toHaveBeenCalled()), test ordering (happy path, error cases, edge cases, complex scenarios), and validation/error-handling patterns for TypeScript/Node.js monorepo code (including Express or frontend React/Vue components where applicable) and toolchains (ESLint, Prettier, Webpack/Vite) with CI/infrastructure considerations (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS) to ensure reliable, maintainable, and debuggable unit and integration tests when writing or refactoring test suites with Jest.
- [React Components with Chakra UI Design System](./standards/react-components-with-chakra-ui-design-system.md) : Build React components using Chakra UI primitives and theme tokens with PM-prefixed wrappers that extend ChakraProvider for consistent accessible maintainable UI patterns in TypeScript React applications
- [React Query Data Fetching Patterns](./standards/react-query-data-fetching-patterns.md) : Standardize React Query (TanStack Query) keys, options factories, and mutation patterns with cache invalidation and typed query definitions to ensure predictable data fetching, consistent cache behavior, and a maintainable API layer.
- [React Router Organization-Scoped Routing](./standards/react-router-organization-scoped-routing.md) : Establish consistent organization-scoped routing patterns in React Router applications with proper authentication, URL validation, and navigation patterns.
- [Structured Logging with PackmindLogger and Datadog](./standards/structured-logging-with-packmindlogger-and-datadog.md) : Enforce structured logging with PackmindLogger and Datadog across Node.js/TypeScript services by creating named PackmindLogger instances with service name and LogLevel enum (default INFO) that emit structured JSON to Datadog from constructors and lifecycle initialization using logger.info/debug and logger.error with sanitized contextual metadata (organizationId, userId, recipeId, standardId, entity IDs) while never logging passwords, tokens, API keys, PII or full request payloads, avoiding console.log, using PackmindErrorHandler.throwError and error instanceof Error checks to convert errors to messages, and choosing error/warn/info/debug levels appropriately to enable reliable debugging, monitoring, observability and security compliance in development and production.
- [TanStack Query Key Management](./standards/tanstack-query-key-management.md) : Manage TanStack Query key structures using hierarchical prefix matching and dedicated queryKeys.ts files in React applications to ensure efficient cache invalidation and type-safe query management when handling cross-domain data operations.
