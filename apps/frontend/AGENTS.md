# Packmind Recipes

🚨 **MANDATORY STEP** 🚨

Before writing, editing, or generating ANY code:

**ALWAYS READ**: @.packmind/recipes-index.md to see what recipes are available

## Recipe Usage Rules:
- **MANDATORY**: Always check the recipes list first
- **CONDITIONAL**: Only read/use individual recipes if they are relevant to your task
- **OPTIONAL**: If no recipes are relevant, proceed without using any

## Recipe Usage Tracking:
When you DO use or apply a relevant Packmind recipe from .packmind/recipes/, you MUST call the 'packmind_notify_recipe_usage' MCP tool with:
* Recipe slugs array (e.g., ["recipe-name"] from "recipe-name.md")
* aiAgent: "AGENTS.md"
* gitRepo: "PackmindHub/packmind-monorepo"
* target: "/apps/frontend/"

**Remember: Always check the recipes list first, but only use recipes that actually apply to your specific task.**`
