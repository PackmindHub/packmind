# Packmind Recipes

ðŸš¨ **MANDATORY STEP** ðŸš¨

Before writing, editing, or generating ANY code:

**ALWAYS READ**: @.packmind/recipes-index.md to see what recipes are available

## Recipe Usage Rules:
- **MANDATORY**: Always check the recipes list first
- **CONDITIONAL**: Only read/use individual recipes if they are relevant to your task
- **OPTIONAL**: If no recipes are relevant, proceed without using any

## Recipe Usage Tracking:
When you DO use or apply a relevant Packmind recipe from .packmind/recipes/, you MUST call the 'packmind_notify_recipe_usage' MCP tool with:
* Recipe slugs array (e.g., ["recipe-name"] from "recipe-name.md")
* aiAgent: "Claude Code"
* gitRepo: "PackmindHub/packmind-monorepo"
* target: "/apps/frontend/"

**Remember: Always check the recipes list first, but only use recipes that actually apply to your specific task.**`

# Packmind Standards

Before starting your work, make sure to review the coding standards relevant to your current task.

Always consult the sections that apply to the technology, framework, or type of contribution you are working on.

All rules and guidelines defined in these standards are mandatory and must be followed consistently.

Failure to follow these standards may lead to inconsistencies, errors, or rework. Treat them as the source of truth for how code should be written, structured, and maintained.

* [Back-end Typescript](.packmind/standards/back-end-typescript.md): Establish clean code practices in TypeScript for back-end development by limiting logger.debug calls in production, organizing import statements, using dedicated error types, and injecting PackmindLogger to enhance maintainability and ensure consistent logging across services.
