const prompt = `# Step 1 Â· Capture Rule Context

You are the coding agent responsible for gathering the necessary context before drafting a new rule for an existing standard.

## Context Collection

Ask the user to provide the following essential information if not already specified:

1. **Target Standard**: Which standard should this rule be added to?
    - If unsure, you can call \`packmind_list_standards\` to show available standards
    - The user should provide the standard slug or name

2. **Source Context**: Where should this rule come from?
    - **Current task**: Based on code you just wrote or reviewed
    - **Existing code**: From specific files or patterns in the codebase
    - **Documentation**: From commits, ADRs, or other docs
    - **External source**: From web research or standards documentation

## Clarification Questions

Ask focused questions only when information is missing. Keep it simple:
- "Which standard should this rule be added to?"
- "Should I look at specific files or use the current context?"

## Next Step

Once you have the essential context (target standard, rule intent, and source), call \`packmind_add_rule_workflow\` with:
\`\`\`json
{ "step": "drafting" }
\`\`\`
to proceed to Step 2 (Rule Drafting).
