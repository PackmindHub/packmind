const prompt = `# Contextualized Coding Standards Creation - AI Agent Instructions Analysis Method

This method analyzes AI coding agent instruction files (copilot-instructions.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .cursor/rules/*.mdc) to create standards based on existing AI guidance and coding preferences.

## Method 4: AI Agent Instructions Analysis

### Step 1: AI Agent Instructions Analysis and Topic Identification

Start by analyzing AI coding agent instruction files in the repository to identify coding preferences, patterns, and guidelines that have been established for AI assistance.

**AI Agent Files Search Strategy:**

1. Search for specific AI agent instruction files:
   - \`copilot-instructions.md\` (GitHub Copilot)
   - \`CLAUDE.md\` (Claude Code)
   - \`AGENTS.md\` (Universal AI agent instructions)
   - \`.cursor/rules/*.mdc\` (Cursor-specific rules)

**File Patterns to Analyze:**

\`\`\`bash
# Find AI agent instruction files
find . -name "copilot-instructions.md" -o -name "CLAUDE.md" -o -name "AGENTS.md"

# Find Cursor rules files
find .cursor/rules -name "*.mdc" 2>/dev/null

# Look for other potential AI instruction files
find . -name "*copilot*" -o -name "*claude*" -o -name "*agent*" | grep -E '.(md|mdc)$'
\`\`\`

**Analysis Focus Areas:**

- **Coding preferences**: Style guidelines specified for AI agents
- **Framework patterns**: Specific patterns or approaches preferred
- **Architecture decisions**: Architectural guidance given to AI agents
- **Testing approaches**: Testing patterns and preferences for AI
- **Code quality rules**: Quality standards specified for AI assistance

**Respond directly in the chat session** with up to 5 areas where standards could be created based on existing AI agent instructions.

**Template Response:**
"I've analyzed the AI coding agent instruction files in your repository and identified these areas where coding standards could be formalized based on existing AI guidance and preferences:

1. **[AI Guidance Area]** - [Brief description based on AI instructions, e.g., "Copilot instructions specify React component patterns that could be standardized"]
2. **[AI Guidance Area]** - [Brief description based on AI preferences]
3. **[AI Guidance Area]** - [Brief description based on AI guidelines]
4. **[AI Guidance Area]** - [Brief description based on AI patterns]
5. **[AI Guidance Area]** - [Brief description based on AI standards]

Which area would you like me to focus on for creating formal coding standards? These suggestions are based on coding preferences and guidelines already established for AI coding assistance."

### Step 2: User Selection & Deep Analysis

Once the user selects a topic, acknowledge their choice and proceed with analysis:

"Excellent choice! I'll analyze the AI coding agent instructions for [SELECTED_AREA] to create formal coding standards based on the coding preferences and guidelines already established for AI assistance..."

**AI Instructions Analysis Process:**

1. **Read relevant AI instruction files** identified in the initial analysis
2. **Extract coding preferences** and style guidelines specified for AI agents
3. **Identify patterns** in the guidance given to different AI agents
4. **Look for consistency themes** across different AI instruction files
5. **Find implicit standards** that could be formalized into explicit rules
6. **Reference existing AI guidance** and build upon established preferences

Then perform deep analysis of the selected area based on existing AI agent instructions.

### Step 3: Standard Generation and Presentation

Create a comprehensive standard with exactly 5 rules based on AI agent instructions analysis.

**Response Structure Template:**
