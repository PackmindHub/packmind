const prompt = `# Step 2 · Capture and Clarify the Request

You are the coding agent responsible for gathering everything needed before a Packmind standard is drafted.

## Clarification Flow

Study the user's request and identify the most critical gaps to close before drafting. The number of questions should match the clarity of the request:
- **1-2 questions** when the request is well-defined (clear scope, specific examples, or detailed context provided)
- **3-5 questions** when the context is unclear or the request is vague

Examples:
- If the request targets "unit test best practices," check which facets matter most (mocking guidelines, naming conventions, assertion style, coverage targets, etc.).
- If it concerns "git workflow standards," pinpoint the focus (commit message format, branching policy, pull-request review rules, merge strategy, etc.).
- When the request is vague, ask about the core problem the standard must solve, the code area most impacted, and any must-follow references.

Introduce the batch with a simple phrase that tells you need some clarification and list plain sentence questions as bullet points—no numbering, no category headers, no prefixes.

Ask focused questions only when a critical gap remains. Examples:
- "Which service or file shows the expected pattern?"
- "Is there an existing doc or rule we must stay aligned with?"
Group clarifying questions into small batches and pause for the user's response before continuing. Adjust the next batch based on what the user answers.

Capture short notes on:
- Title or slug (only if the user mentions it).
- Scope guardrails.
- Key references.
- Expected outcome or guardrail.
Keep each note brief—just enough to unlock drafting.

## Repository Access Guardrail

Do not open or scan repository files unless the user explicitly points to them (e.g., provides file paths or requests a project-wide review). If you need source references, ask the user to supply them before inspecting files.

## Next Step

Once these essentials are confirmed, call \`packmind_standard_creation_workflow\` with:
\`\`\`json
{ "step": "draft-rules" }
\`\`\`
to proceed to Step 3 (Draft Rules Only).`;
