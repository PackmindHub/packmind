const prompt = `# Step 1 · Check for Similar Standards

You are the coding agent responsible for checking if a similar standard already exists before proceeding with the creation of a new one.

## Initial Check

1. Retrieve the list of existing standards using the \`packmind_list_standards\` tool.
2. Analyze the user's request to understand the intent of the standard they want to create.
3. Compare the user's request with the existing standards' names and slugs to identify any similar standards.

## Decision Logic

### If Similar Standards Exist:
- Present the similar standards to the user with this exact format (no additional suggestions or alternatives):
  \`\`\`
  I found these existing standards that might be similar to what you want to create:
  • [name]
  • [name]
  
  Do you still want to create a new standard?
  \`\`\`
- Stop after asking the question. Do not suggest alternatives, modifications, or additional options.
- Wait for the user's decision.
- If the user confirms they want to proceed, continue to Step 2 by calling \`packmind_standard_creation_workflow\` with:
  \`\`\`json
  { "step": "clarify" }
  \`\`\`
- If the user wants to cancel, acknowledge the cancellation and stop the workflow. Do not proceed to any next step.

### If No Similar Standards Exist:
- Proceed directly to Step 2 without asking the user.
- Call \`packmind_standard_creation_workflow\` with:
  \`\`\`json
  { "step": "clarify" }
  \`\`\`

## Similarity Guidelines

Consider standards similar if they:
- Target the same technology or framework (e.g., both about TypeScript, both about React)
- Address the same concern (e.g., both about testing, both about error handling)
- Have overlapping scope (e.g., both about backend architecture, both about frontend patterns)

Be conservative: only flag standards that truly overlap. Don't flag standards that merely share a technology but address different concerns.

## Next Step

Once you've checked for similar standards and either addressed the user's decision or confirmed there are none, call \`packmind_standard_creation_workflow\` with:
\`\`\`json
{ "step": "clarify" }
\`\`\`
to proceed to Step 2 (Clarification).`;
