## Standard: Back-end TypeScript Clean Code Practices

Establish back-end TypeScript clean code rules in the Packmind monorepo (/packages/**/*.ts)—including PackmindLogger constructor injection, disciplined logger.info/error usage, top-of-file static imports, custom Error subclasses, and adapter-created use cases with their own loggers—to improve maintainability, debuggability, and consistent architecture across services. :
* Avoid excessive logger.debug calls in production code and limit logging to essential logger.info statements. Use logger.info for important business events, logger.error for error handling, and add logger.debug manually only when debugging specific issues.
* Inject PackmindLogger as a constructor parameter with a default value using a variable or a string representing the class name.
* Instantiate use cases in adapters without passing the adapter's logger; use cases must create their own logger for proper origin tracking.
* Keep all import statements at the top of the file before any other code. Never use dynamic imports in the middle of the code unless absolutely necessary for code splitting or lazy loading.
* Use dedicated error types instead of generic Error instances to enable precise error handling and improve code maintainability. Create custom error classes that extend Error with descriptive names and context-specific information.
