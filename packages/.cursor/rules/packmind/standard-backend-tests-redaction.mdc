## Standard: Backend Tests Redaction

Enforce Jest backend test conventions in Packmind **/*.spec.ts (verb-first names, behavioral assertions, nested `describe('when...')`, one `expect`, `afterEach` cleanup with `datasource.destroy()` and `jest.clearAllMocks()`, `toEqual` for arrays, and `stubLogger()` for typed `PackmindLogger` stubs) to improve readability, consistency, and debuggability while preventing inter-test pollution. :
* Avoid asserting on stubbed logger output like specific messages or call counts; instead verify observable behavior or return values
* Avoid testing that a method is a function; instead invoke the method and assert its observable behavior
* Avoid testing that registry components are defined; instead test the actual behavior and functionality of the registry methods like registration, retrieval, and error handling
* Move 'when' contextual clauses from `it()` into nested `describe('when...')` blocks
* Never write dummy tests without logic (like expect.true.toBe(true))
* Remove explicit 'Arrange, Act, Assert' comments from tests and structure them so the setup, execution, and verification phases are clear without redundant labels
* Use afterEach to call datasource.destroy() to clean up the test database whenever you initialize it in beforeEach
* Use afterEach(() => jest.clearAllMocks()) instead of beforeEach(() => jest.clearAllMocks()) to clear mocks after each test and prevent inter-test pollution
* Use assertive, verb-first unit test names instead of starting with 'should'
* Use expect(actualArray).toEqual(expectedArray) for deep array equality in Jest tests instead of manual length and index checks
* Use one expect per test case for better clarity and easier debugging; group related tests in describe blocks with shared setup in beforeEach
* Use stubLogger() in Jest tests to get a fully typed PackmindLogger stub instead of manually creating a jest.Mocked<PackmindLogger> object with jest.fn() methods
