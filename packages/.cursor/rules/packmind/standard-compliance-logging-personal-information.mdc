## Standard: Compliance - Logging Personal Information

Enforce masking of personal information in TypeScript logs, using a standard first-6-characters-plus-* format for emails and similar patterns for other identifiers, to protect user privacy, comply with data protection regulations, and reduce security risks when handling user-related log entries. :
* Never log personal information in clear text across all log levels. Always mask sensitive data such as emails, phone numbers, IP addresses, and other personally identifiable information before logging.
* Use the standard masking format of first 6 characters followed by "*" for logging user emails. This ensures consistency across the codebase and makes it easier to audit logs for compliance.
