**ALWAYS READ**: the available recipes below to see what recipes are available

## Recipe Usage Rules:
- **MANDATORY**: Always check the recipes list first

**Remember: Always check the recipes list first, but only use recipes that actually apply to your specific task.**`

## Available recipes

- [Create New Package](.packmind/recipes/create-new-package-in-monorepo.md) : Create a new buildable TypeScript package in the Packmind Nx monorepo, wiring up TypeScript paths, TypeORM, and Webpack so it can serve as a reusable shared or domain-specific library for consistent, type-safe code reuse across applications.
- [Repository Implementation and Testing Pattern](.packmind/recipes/repository-implementation-and-testing-pattern.md) : Implement a standardized repository with soft delete functionality and comprehensive tests to ensure maintainable code and reliable data access patterns in the Packmind codebase.
- [Create or update model and TypeORM schemas](.packmind/recipes/create-or-update-model-and-typeorm-schemas.md) : Create and evolve TypeORM-backed domain models, schemas, repositories, and migrations to keep your database structure consistent, maintainable, and backward compatible when business requirements or existing entities change.
