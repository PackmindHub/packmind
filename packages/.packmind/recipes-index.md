# Packmind Recipes Index

This recipes index contains all available coding recipes that can be used by AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to find and use proven patterns in coding tasks.

## Available Recipes

- [Create New Package](recipes/create-new-package-in-monorepo.md) : Create a new buildable TypeScript package in the Packmind Nx monorepo, wiring up TypeScript paths, TypeORM, and Webpack so it can serve as a reusable shared or domain-specific library for consistent, type-safe code reuse across applications.
- [Create or update model and TypeORM schemas](recipes/create-or-update-model-and-typeorm-schemas.md) : Create and evolve TypeORM-backed domain models, schemas, repositories, and migrations to keep your database structure consistent, maintainable, and backward compatible when business requirements or existing entities change.
- [Repository Implementation and Testing Pattern](recipes/repository-implementation-and-testing-pattern.md) : Implement a standardized repository with soft delete functionality and comprehensive tests to ensure maintainable code and reliable data access patterns in the Packmind codebase.
