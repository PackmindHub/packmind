# Packmind Standards Index

This standards index contains all available coding standards that can be used by AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to find and apply proven practices in coding tasks.

## Available Standards

- [Back-end repositories SQL queries using TypeORM](./standards/back-end-repositories-sql-queries-using-typeorm.md) : Implement SQL query guidelines using TypeORM's QueryBuilder in back-end repositories under /infra/repositories/*Repository.ts to enhance type safety, prevent SQL injection, and improve code maintainability when writing database queries, including lookups, joins, and handling soft-deleted entities.
- [Back-end TypeScript Clean Code Practices](./standards/back-end-typescript-clean-code-practices.md) : Apply back-end TypeScript clean code practices by implementing logging best practices, error handling with custom error types, and organized code structure to enhance maintainability and ensure consistent patterns across services in the Packmind monorepo when writing services, use cases, controllers, and any back-end TypeScript code.
- [Backend Tests Redaction](./standards/backend-tests-redaction.md) : Define Jest backend test patterns in the Packmind monorepo that emphasize behavioral assertions, clear describe/it organization with shared setup/teardown (including datasource.destroy, jest.clearAllMocks, and stubLogger), and single-expect deep equality to keep tests readable, maintainable, and reliable.
- [Compliance - Logging Personal Information](./standards/compliance-logging-personal-information.md) : Ensure personal information is masked in logs using a standard format in TypeScript projects to maintain user privacy and comply with data protection regulations when logging user-related information or debugging authentication flows.
- [Domain Events](./standards/domain-events.md) : Use when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners.
- [Jest Test Suite Organization and Patterns](./standards/jest-test-suite-organization-and-patterns.md) : Establish Jest test suite organization and patterns governing test file structure, describe/it hierarchy, typed mocking using jest.Mocked<ServiceType> and createMockInstance, factory-based test data and @packmind/types createUserId/createOrganizationId/createStandardId helpers, assertion conventions (single primary assertion, .not.toHaveBeenCalled()), test ordering (happy path, error cases, edge cases, complex scenarios), and validation/error-handling patterns for TypeScript/Node.js monorepo code (including Express or frontend React/Vue components where applicable) and toolchains (ESLint, Prettier, Webpack/Vite) with CI/infrastructure considerations (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS) to ensure reliable, maintainable, and debuggable unit and integration tests when writing or refactoring test suites with Jest.
- [Port-Adapter Cross-Domain Integration](./standards/port-adapter-cross-domain-integration.md) : Define port-adapter cross-domain integration for domain packages in a TypeScript/Node.js DDD monorepo by declaring port interfaces in @packmind/types with Command/Response contracts under packages/types/src/<domain>/contracts/, exposing adapters only via Hexa public getter methods and retrieving provider adapters through the registry while typing stored references as port interfaces, implementing async initialize() on HexaFactory with registry isRegistered()/get() checks for deferred dependencies to enable synchronous and asynchronous operations with graceful degradation and prevent circular dependencies and tight coupling, and enforce these patterns across tooling and workflows (ESLint/Prettier, Webpack/Vite), testing (Jest/Vitest), ORMs/libs (TypeORM/Prisma), and infrastructure pipelines (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS) to ensure maintainability, testability, and safe cross-domain integration when composing domains.
- [Use Case Architecture Patterns](./standards/use-case-architecture-patterns.md) : Standardize Packmind monorepo use case architecture using hexagonal principles, typed command/response contracts, and role-specific base classes (AbstractMemberUseCase, AbstractAdminUseCase, IPublicUseCase, PackmindCommand/PublicPackmindCommand) to ensure consistent authentication/authorization behavior, clean interfaces, and type-safe command passing via full command objects and port/adapter reuse.
- [UseCase Test Structure and Validation](./standards/usecase-test-structure-and-validation.md) : Define testing patterns for use case unit tests to ensure consistent organization and comprehensive validation coverage in the Packmind hexagonal architecture.
