# Packmind Standards Index

This standards index contains all available coding standards that can be used by AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to find and apply proven practices in coding tasks.

## Available Standards

- [Back-end repositories SQL queries using TypeORM](./standards/back-end-repositories-sql-queries-using-typeorm.md) : Standardize use of TypeORM QueryBuilder with parameterized WHERE/AND WHERE and IN (:...param) clauses in /infra/repositories/*.ts, including correct handling of soft-deleted entities via withDeleted() or includeDeleted options, to ensure type safety, prevent SQL injection, and improve maintainability and testability of all repository queries.
- [Back-end TypeScript Clean Code Practices](./standards/back-end-typescript-clean-code-practices.md) : Establish back-end TypeScript clean code rules in the Packmind monorepo (/packages/**/*.ts)—including PackmindLogger constructor injection, disciplined logger.info/error usage, top-of-file static imports, custom Error subclasses, and adapter-created use cases with their own loggers—to improve maintainability, debuggability, and consistent architecture across services.
- [Backend Tests Redaction](./standards/backend-tests-redaction.md) : Enforce Jest backend test conventions in Packmind **/*.spec.ts (verb-first names, behavioral assertions, nested `describe('when...')`, one `expect`, `afterEach` cleanup with `datasource.destroy()` and `jest.clearAllMocks()`, `toEqual` for arrays, and `stubLogger()` for typed `PackmindLogger` stubs) to improve readability, consistency, and debuggability while preventing inter-test pollution.
- [Compliance - Logging Personal Information](./standards/compliance-logging-personal-information.md) : Enforce masking of personal information in TypeScript logs, using a standard first-6-characters-plus-* format for emails and similar patterns for other identifiers, to protect user privacy, comply with data protection regulations, and reduce security risks when handling user-related log entries.
- [Domain Events](./standards/domain-events.md) : Use when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners.
- [Jest Test Suite Organization and Patterns](./standards/jest-test-suite-organization-and-patterns.md) : Establish Jest test suite organization and patterns governing test file structure, describe/it hierarchy, typed mocking using jest.Mocked<ServiceType> and createMockInstance, factory-based test data and @packmind/types createUserId/createOrganizationId/createStandardId helpers, assertion conventions (single primary assertion, .not.toHaveBeenCalled()), test ordering (happy path, error cases, edge cases, complex scenarios), and validation/error-handling patterns for TypeScript/Node.js monorepo code (including Express or frontend React/Vue components where applicable) and toolchains (ESLint, Prettier, Webpack/Vite) with CI/infrastructure considerations (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS) to ensure reliable, maintainable, and debuggable unit and integration tests when writing or refactoring test suites with Jest.
- [Port-Adapter Cross-Domain Integration](./standards/port-adapter-cross-domain-integration.md) : Define port interfaces and cross-domain contracts in @packmind/types and packages/types/src/<domain>/contracts/, expose adapters via Hexa getters, and use async HexaFactory.initialize() with registry isRegistered()/get() checks to prevent circular dependencies, maintain loose coupling, and support resilient synchronous and asynchronous cross-domain operations.
- [Use Case Architecture Patterns](./standards/use-case-architecture-patterns.md) : Standardize Packmind monorepo use case architecture using hexagonal principles, typed command/response contracts, and role-specific base classes (AbstractMemberUseCase, AbstractAdminUseCase, IPublicUseCase, PackmindCommand/PublicPackmindCommand) to ensure consistent authentication/authorization behavior, clean interfaces, and type-safe command passing via full command objects and port/adapter reuse.
- [UseCase Test Structure and Validation](./standards/usecase-test-structure-and-validation.md) : Define testing patterns for use case unit tests to ensure consistent organization and comprehensive validation coverage in the Packmind hexagonal architecture.
