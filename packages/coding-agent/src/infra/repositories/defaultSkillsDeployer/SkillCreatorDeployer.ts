# Skill Creator

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend ${agentName}'s capabilities by providing
specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific
domains or tasks—they transform ${agentName} from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent
equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

### What Skills Provide

1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

\`\`\`
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
\`\`\`

#### SKILL.md (required)

**Metadata Quality:** The \`name\` and \`description\` in YAML frontmatter determine when ${agentName} will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. "This skill should be used when..." instead of "Use this skill when...").

#### Bundled Resources (optional)

##### Scripts (\`scripts/\`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: \`scripts/rotate_pdf.py\` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context
- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by ${agentName} for patching or environment-specific adjustments

##### References (\`references/\`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform ${agentName}'s process and thinking.

- **When to include**: For documentation that ${agentName} should reference while working
- **Examples**: \`references/finance.md\` for financial schemas, \`references/mnda.md\` for company NDA template, \`references/policies.md\` for company policies, \`references/api_docs.md\` for API specifications
- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides
- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when ${agentName} determines it's needed
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md
- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.

##### Assets (\`assets/\`)

Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output ${agentName} produces.

- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output
- **Examples**: \`assets/logo.png\` for brand assets, \`assets/slides.pptx\` for PowerPoint templates, \`assets/frontend-template/\` for HTML/React boilerplate, \`assets/font.ttf\` for typography
- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified
- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables ${agentName} to use files without loading them into context

### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle

Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by ${agentName} (Unlimited\\*)

\\*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.

## Prerequisites

Before running any skill scripts, verify that the required tools are available:

### Python 3

Check if Python 3 is installed:

\`\`\`bash
python3 --version
\`\`\`

If not available, install it:
- **macOS**: \`brew install python3\`
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: \`sudo apt-get install python3\`
- **Windows**: Download from https://python.org or use \`winget install Python.Python.3\`

### Packmind CLI

Check if packmind-cli is installed:

\`\`\`bash
packmind-cli --version
\`\`\`

If not available, install it:

\`\`\`bash
npm install -g packmind-cli
\`\`\`

## Skill Creation Process

To create a skill, follow the "Skill Creation Process" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.

### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples

Skip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.

To create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.

For example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:

- "What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?"
- "Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?"
- "I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?"
- "What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"

To avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.

Conclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.

### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents

To turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:

1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch
2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly

Example: When building a \`pdf-editor\` skill to handle queries like "Help me rotate this PDF," the analysis shows:

1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time
2. A \`scripts/rotate_pdf.py\` script would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When designing a \`frontend-webapp-builder\` skill for queries like "Build me a todo app" or "Build me a dashboard to track my steps," the analysis shows:

1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time
2. An \`assets/hello-world/\` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill

Example: When building a \`big-query\` skill to handle queries like "How many users have logged in today?" the analysis shows:

1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time
2. A \`references/schema.md\` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill

To establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.

### Step 3: Initializing the Skill

At this point, it is time to actually create the skill.

Skip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.

**Before running the script**, verify that python3 and packmind-cli are available (see Prerequisites section). If not installed, install them first.

When creating a new skill from scratch, always run the \`init_skill.py\` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.

Usage:

\`\`\`bash
python3 scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
\`\`\`

The script:

- Creates the skill directory at the specified path
- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders
- Creates example resource directories: \`scripts/\`, \`references/\`, and \`assets/\`
- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted

After initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.

### Step 4: Edit the Skill

When editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of ${agentName} to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to ${agentName}. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another ${agentName} instance execute these tasks more effectively.

#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents

To begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: \`scripts/\`, \`references/\`, and \`assets/\` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a \`brand-guidelines\` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in \`assets/\`, or documentation to store in \`references/\`.

Also, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in \`scripts/\`, \`references/\`, and \`assets/\` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.

#### Update SKILL.md

**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., "To accomplish X, do Y" rather than "You should do X" or "If you need to do X"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.

To complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:

1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?
2. When should the skill be used?
3. In practice, how should ${agentName} use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that ${agentName} knows how to use them.

### Step 5: Packaging a Skill

Once the skill is ready, it should be packaged into a distributable zip file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements.

**Before running the script**, verify that python3 and packmind-cli are available (see Prerequisites section). If not installed, install them first.

\`\`\`bash
python3 scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>
\`\`\`

Optional output directory specification:

\`\`\`bash
python3 scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist
\`\`\`

The packaging script will:

1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:
   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields
   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure
   - Description completeness and quality
   - File organization and resource references

2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a zip file named after the skill (e.g., \`my-skill.zip\`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution.

If validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.

### Step 6: Iterate

After testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.

**Iteration workflow:**

1. Use the skill on real tasks
2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies
3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated
4. Implement changes and test again

### Step 7: Distributing a Skill

Once the skill is packaged and ready for distribution, use packmind-cli to add it to the skills registry.

**Before running the command**, verify that packmind-cli is available (see Prerequisites section). If not installed, install it first.

\`\`\`bash
packmind-cli skills add <path/to/skill-folder>
\`\`\`

This command registers the skill with Packmind, making it available for deployment to target repositories and AI coding agents.

## Overview

[TODO: 1-2 sentences explaining what this skill enables]

## Structuring This Skill

[TODO: Choose the structure that best fits this skill's purpose. Common patterns:

**1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)
- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures
- Example: DOCX skill with "Workflow Decision Tree" → "Reading" → "Creating" → "Editing"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Workflow Decision Tree → ## Step 1 → ## Step 2...

**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)
- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities
- Example: PDF skill with "Quick Start" → "Merge PDFs" → "Split PDFs" → "Extract Text"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Quick Start → ## Task Category 1 → ## Task Category 2...

**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)
- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements
- Example: Brand styling with "Brand Guidelines" → "Colors" → "Typography" → "Features"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Guidelines → ## Specifications → ## Usage...

**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)
- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features
- Example: Product Management with "Core Capabilities" → numbered capability list
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Core Capabilities → ### 1. Feature → ### 2. Feature...

Patterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most skills combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex operations).

Delete this entire "Structuring This Skill" section when done - it's just guidance.]

## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]

[TODO: Add content here. See examples in existing skills:
- Code samples for technical skills
- Decision trees for complex workflows
- Concrete examples with realistic user requests
- References to scripts/templates/references as needed]

## Resources

This skill includes example resource directories that demonstrate how to organize different types of bundled resources:

### scripts/
Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) that can be run directly to perform specific operations.

**Examples from other skills:**
- PDF skill: \\\`fill_fillable_fields.py\\\`, \\\`extract_form_field_info.py\\\` - utilities for PDF manipulation
- DOCX skill: \\\`document.py\\\`, \\\`utilities.py\\\` - Python modules for document processing

**Appropriate for:** Python scripts, shell scripts, or any executable code that performs automation, data processing, or specific operations.

**Note:** Scripts may be executed without loading into context, but can still be read by ${agentName} for patching or environment adjustments.

### references/
Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded into context to inform ${agentName}'s process and thinking.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Product management: \\\`communication.md\\\`, \\\`context_building.md\\\` - detailed workflow guides
- BigQuery: API reference documentation and query examples
- Finance: Schema documentation, company policies

**Appropriate for:** In-depth documentation, API references, database schemas, comprehensive guides, or any detailed information that ${agentName} should reference while working.

### assets/
Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output ${agentName} produces.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Brand styling: PowerPoint template files (.pptx), logo files
- Frontend builder: HTML/React boilerplate project directories
- Typography: Font files (.ttf, .woff2)

**Appropriate for:** Templates, boilerplate code, document templates, images, icons, fonts, or any files meant to be copied or used in the final output.

---

**Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every skill requires all three types of resources.

const SKILL_CREATOR_README = `# Skill Creator

A skill that guides AI coding agents through the process of creating effective skills.

## What is a Skill?

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend AI coding agents' capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific domains or tasks.

## What This Skill Does

When users ask the AI agent to create a new skill, this skill provides:

1. **Structured workflow** - A step-by-step process for skill creation
2. **Python scripts** - Tools for initializing, validating, and packaging skills
3. **Best practices** - Guidelines for effective skill design

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure you have:

- **Python 3**: Required to run the helper scripts
- **packmind-cli**: Required for skill distribution

## Directory Structure

\`\`\`
skill-creator/
├── SKILL.md           # Instructions for the AI agent
├── README.md          # This file (for humans)
├── LICENSE.txt        # Apache 2.0 license
└── scripts/
    ├── init_skill.py      # Initialize a new skill from template
    ├── package_skill.py   # Package a skill for distribution
    └── quick_validate.py  # Validate skill structure
\`\`\`

## Scripts Usage

### Initialize a New Skill

\`\`\`bash
python3 scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
\`\`\`

Creates a new skill directory with:
- SKILL.md template with TODO placeholders
- Example scripts/, references/, and assets/ directories

### Validate a Skill

\`\`\`bash
python3 scripts/quick_validate.py <path/to/skill-folder>
\`\`\`

Checks:
- YAML frontmatter format
- Required fields (name, description)
- Naming conventions

### Package a Skill

\`\`\`bash
python3 scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> [output-directory]
\`\`\`

Creates a distributable zip file after validation passes.

### Distribute a Skill

\`\`\`bash
packmind-cli skills add <path/to/skill-folder>
\`\`\`

Registers the skill with Packmind for deployment.
