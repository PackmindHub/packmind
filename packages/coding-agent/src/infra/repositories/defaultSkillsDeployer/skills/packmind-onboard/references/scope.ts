## Guarantees

- **Read-only analysis.** Analysis phase does not modify any project files.
- **Drafts before creation.** All items are written as drafts first, allowing review before creation.
- **Preserve existing.** Never overwrite existing artifacts. If a slug already exists, create \`-2\`, \`-3\`, etc.
- **Evidence required.** Every reported insight must include file-path evidence (and line ranges when feasible).
- **Focused output.** Max **5 Standards** and **5 Commands** generated per run.
- **Graceful failure.** Partial failures don't lose successful work; failed drafts are preserved.
- **User control.** When packages exist, users confirm package selection before creation.

## Definitions

- **Pattern (non-linter):** a convention a linter cannot reliably enforce (module boundaries, cross-domain communication, workflow parity, error semantics, etc).
- **Evidence:** \`path[:line-line]\` entries; omit line ranges only when the file isn't text-searchable.
