# Packmind Standards Index

This standards index contains all available coding standards that can be used by AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to find and apply proven practices in coding tasks.

## Available Standards

- [Back-end repositories SQL queries using TypeORM](./standards/back-end-repositories-sql-queries-using-typeorm.md) : Standardize use of TypeORM QueryBuilder with parameterized WHERE/AND WHERE and IN (:...param) clauses in /infra/repositories/*.ts, including correct handling of soft-deleted entities via withDeleted() or includeDeleted options, to ensure type safety, prevent SQL injection, and improve maintainability and testability of all repository queries.
- [Back-end TypeScript Clean Code Practices](./standards/back-end-typescript-clean-code-practices.md) : Apply back-end TypeScript clean code practices by implementing logging best practices, error handling with custom error types, and organized code structure to enhance maintainability and ensure consistent patterns across services in the Packmind monorepo when writing services, use cases, controllers, and any back-end TypeScript code.
- [Backend Tests Redaction](./standards/backend-tests-redaction.md) : Define Jest backend test patterns in the Packmind monorepo that emphasize behavioral assertions, clear describe/it organization with shared setup/teardown (including datasource.destroy, jest.clearAllMocks, and stubLogger), and single-expect deep equality to keep tests readable, maintainable, and reliable.
- [Changelog](./standards/changelog.md) : Maintain CHANGELOG.MD using Keep a Changelog format with a top [Unreleased] section linked to HEAD, ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD), and per-release comparison links like [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/compare/release/<previous>...release/X.Y.Z to ensure accurate, consistent release documentation and version links.
- [Compliance - Logging Personal Information](./standards/compliance-logging-personal-information.md) : Enforce masking of personal information in TypeScript logs, using a standard first-6-characters-plus-* format for emails and similar patterns for other identifiers, to protect user privacy, comply with data protection regulations, and reduce security risks when handling user-related log entries.
- [Domain Events](./standards/domain-events.md) : Use when creating domain events, emitting events from use cases, or implementing listeners.
- [NestJS Module Hierarchy](./standards/nestjs-module-hierarchy.md) : Establish a consistent NestJS module hierarchy using RouterModule.register() for routing and dedicated modules for each resource in the apps/api/src/app/ directory to enhance maintainability and scalability by mirroring the URL hierarchy and ensuring clear separation of concerns across the codebase, applicable to all modules including controllers, services, and modules.
- [Testing good practices](./standards/testing-good-practices.md) : Standardize unit test structure and naming in TypeScript/TSX test files using verb-first descriptions, Arrange-Act-Assert flow without comments, nested describe('when...') context blocks, and single-expect test cases to improve readability, maintainability, and debugging.
- [Use Case Architecture Patterns](./standards/use-case-architecture-patterns.md) : Standardize Packmind monorepo use case architecture using hexagonal principles, typed command/response contracts, and role-specific base classes (AbstractMemberUseCase, AbstractAdminUseCase, IPublicUseCase, PackmindCommand/PublicPackmindCommand) to ensure consistent authentication/authorization behavior, clean interfaces, and type-safe command passing via full command objects and port/adapter reuse.
- [UseCase Test Structure and Validation](./standards/usecase-test-structure-and-validation.md) : Define testing patterns for use case unit tests to ensure consistent organization and comprehensive validation coverage in the Packmind hexagonal architecture.
