# Changelog

Maintain a consistent and well-structured CHANGELOG.MD file following the Keep a Changelog format to ensure all releases are properly documented with accurate version links and dates. This standard applies whenever creating or updating the CHANGELOG.MD file in the repository root.

## Rules

* Ensure all released versions have their corresponding comparison links defined at the bottom of the CHANGELOG.MD file in the format [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/PackmindHub/packmind/compare/release/<previous>...release/X.Y.Z
* Format all release dates using the ISO 8601 date format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-11-21) to ensure consistent and internationally recognized date representation
* Maintain an [Unreleased] section at the top of the changelog with its corresponding link at the bottom pointing to HEAD to track ongoing changes between releases
